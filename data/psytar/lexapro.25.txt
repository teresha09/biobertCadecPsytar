Disturbed sleep, exhaustion, nausea, dizzyness, jaw-clenching and increased anxiety. I took 5mg for three days and when my Dr. heard what it was doing to me she said to stop it immediately. It's been four days since I discontinued, and I'm still wiped out and dizzy with flu-like symptoms. She had suggested I add Lexapro to my Remeron to boost the serotonin effects. I'll just stick with the Remeron . so much gentler on my system. Everyone is different, but for me Lexapro was like some kind of torture device, Can't wait for it to leave my system.

yawning, spaciness, dizziness, insomnia, affected my impulse control, increased appetite, headache. I was torn about this drug. It definitely alleviated my suicidal thoughts and after 2 months, I felt I was in a grey area rather than deep black. BUT, hated the physical side effects, I took valerian (okayed by doctor) to offset the insomina - but weirdest was I realized only after I went off it how it affected my eating habits - I put on weight - around 10 lbs - in the 2.5 months on it - no impulse control and "munchy" syndrome - this was counterproductive as I had lost a lot and putting it on made me depressed! Withdrawal was odd - first 2 days nothing, then the third day, waves of nausea, headache, dizziness. Day 4 and 5 and now (Day 6) DEFINITE brain zaps - didn't know what people were talking about until they started - NOT nice . and I was only on 2.5 months . overall - DOES do what it is supposed to do - you need to weight whether it is worth the side effects

Mild sleeplessness, unsatisfying yawns that went away after a month or so. What I hate most though is the clenching of the jaw, That hasn't gone away, Overall, I'm happy with Lexapro. I'm relieved to see that a lot of you are reporting clenching of the jaw. I thought there was something seriously wrong with mine, so I'm glad to know it is a side effect and not something else.

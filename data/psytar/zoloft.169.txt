Generally very mild. Slightly delayed orgasm and some strange dreams. I tend to sleep longer in the morning. Completely silenced the endless tape loop in my head that kept telling me about all the horrible things that would probably happen. Hasn't changed my personality, but turned me into the person I'm supposed to be. Won't work for everyone, but worked wonders for me!

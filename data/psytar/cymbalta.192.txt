Not many. Suddenly stopping can cause jitters and loss of sleep. Likewise, starting a high dose without ramping up can cause the same thing. These effects go away in 1-3 days. I sometimes supplement with Lexapro 20mg if my depression or anxiety increases for more than a couple of weeks. After 2-3 months with the Lexapro, I cut back to just Cymbalta, which has worked better than anything else I've ever tried, with fewer side effects.

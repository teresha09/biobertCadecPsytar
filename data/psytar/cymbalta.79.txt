Extreme sleepiness and tiredness. Some bouts of sudden depression and anxiety while on it. Intense feelings meaning whenever I was happy, I was extremely happy and sad I was extremely depressed and crying. Wild dreams. I dreamed my sister tried to kill me. It made me feel worse. I was just weaning off Lexapro after 2 1/2 months because Lexapro stopped working and caused fatigue and my doc switched me to cymbalta. I was hitting caffeine everyday on this med Made me extremely tired especially more while weaning off lexapro with the combination of the two drugs. Not near as good as Lexapro was when I first started taking it. Saw that it was not working after a month, just making me worse and I decided to get off it. I am on effexor now and I'm not sure I'm going to stay on it. I heard it was making people dense, like Lexapro started to do to me. The withdrawal I heard was also a pain. Overall, Cymbalta made me worse over the month period. I think it worth trying, because everyone is different. I don't think it is an anxiety drug though.

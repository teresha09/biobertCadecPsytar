Nausea, stomach upsets. I found lexapro was the best antidepressant for me. Possible side affect was reduced sexual desire, but my doctor said this could be just from the depression and stress itself. Am returning to lexapro after trying pristiq because of said sexual problems. Would rather be happy and not having sex than psychotic. :(

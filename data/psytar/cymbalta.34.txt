insomnia, vivid dreams, syncope, a detached from the body feeling, confusion, restlessness, shaky, trembling. Took the med for only 3 days and the first night, I think I got a total of 2 hours of sleep. On the third day at work, I experienced what felt like an 'acid trip' after about an hour of taking the recomended 30 mg dose. I couldn't talk without stuttering, was very confused, couldn't concentrate. Had to have me b/f pick me up and take me to ER. Said it was side effects of med. I had low blood pressure for about 2 weeks after I stopped taking it which caused me to have fainting spells. Fainted at work, hit my head and had to go to ER again. So after all is said and done, I still have fibromyalgia pain, now even worse it seems, and have a shit load of ER bills. Highly reconsider taking this med if you have not already done so.

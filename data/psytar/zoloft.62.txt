Dizziness, loss of appetite (initially), "staring into space". I originally was on Zoloft for two or three years and then stopped taking it, but had started to develop symptoms of depression again about 2 1/2 years ago. When I first starting retaking it, I had no appetite for about 2 months, but that went away. More recently, I have experienced dizziness when standing, especially after I get out of the car. My dosage was increased earlier this year after a traumatic episode and I found the dizziness to be worse. I haven't fainted but I started to see black spots. My doctor recommended that I try decreasing it. I am still dizzy but a little better I also find that I will sometimes zone out. Despite the side effects, I have found Zoloft helpful in keeping my moods moderated, especially when I feel low (though, on the other hand, I also don't really ever feel extremely happy on it either).

only experienced side effects such as Nausea for the first week or two of taking this medication. Though I do have extreme withdrawal symptoms if I skip more than one day. Withdrawal for me is being dizzy and extremely sleepy. This medication is supposedly supposed to help with anxiety, but for me, I have to take a second medication for that.

few side effects at first, but now, after about months on the stuff, at about 20 hours after last dose, I start to get wierd feelings. ALmost shakey, or tremors, but they are "below the surface" rather than something visible. More like I feel as though I am vibrating. Sometimes ringing in my ear, or lightheadedness. I was here looking for anyone who sensed the drug was moving them towards taking a higher dose (one friend suggested this might be the problem). It did work well for my depression, but reading these make me wonder about other things that have been going on - like the pins & needles I attributed to some other mystery. Still concerned about the apparent 'withdrawl' in less than 24 hours between doses.

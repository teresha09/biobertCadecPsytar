Weight gain, hair loss, headaches, insomnia. Bad side effects when weaned off like brain zaps, anxiety. My depression was eleviated but I still wasn't myself, even when I went up to 200 mg. The side effects got to be too much (headaches everyday, problems sleeping, gained 10 pounds, would lose a handful of hair everyday) and I weaned myself off of it, only to experience strange seizure-like zaps in my brain that would last for just a second but were very distressing.

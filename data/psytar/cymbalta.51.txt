Horrible. Totally horse tranq knocked out for 12hrs within 2hrs of tasking it couldn't focus on anything laid down and stayed there all day apart from running to the toilet with diarrhoea a few times. Could sleep later without restless legs then slept for another 12hrs. One of the worst meds I've been on.

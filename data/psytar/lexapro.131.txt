Dry mouth the first month and then later bouts of extreme thirst, I think it also gives me headaches and neckaches, but I am not sure because I was diagnosed with migraines previous to this medicine. The side effects I have experienced when MISSING a dose or more are: jittery-ness, dizziness and vertigo, nausea, swells in mood, overall awful feeling. Would not recommend quitting cold turkey. I've tried quite a few antidepressants and this one seems to be the one that handles my depression and I can live with the side effects. I have been on this in the past and gone off of it several times, but I have come to realize that this particular medicine significantly improves my life quality. I am trying really hard to stay on it this time. Some people have mentioned that this medicine doesn't work for mild depression, just major or suicidal depressives, I disagree.

Major weight gain, 30 lbs in 2 years. Works great for my depression, but caused excessive hunger leading to a 30 lb weight gain in 2 years. My doctor took me off it 4 days ago and immediatly switched me over to Wellbutrin XL the next day. I have been having terrible withdrawl symtoms almost immedatly after stopping the med, dizziness, headache, nausea, sweating, I went back to the doctor today and got Cymbalta 30 mg tabs (I had been on 60mg) and now are being weened gradually while still continuing the Wellbutrin XL. After taking the 30 mg tab this morning I already feel much better. Be careful coming off this, it is a very powerful drug.

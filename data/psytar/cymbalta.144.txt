Really I haven't noticed any side effects when taking it but a bit of sleepiness initially. It has worked exceptionally well for my depression. I can tell you from mine and others experiences that the drug withdrawal symptoms are very severe and affect every body system you have. I missed a couple once and the side effects are the worst I have ever encountered from my many medications I have taken over the course of 30 years with this disorder. I have been on almost the whole array of psychiatric drugs and withdrawal from this one is the worst I have ever encountered. I have a friend whose husband takes this drug for fibromyalgia and tried to get off it because they can't afford this medicine, but the withdrawal was so bad for him. I guess they will have to keep the extra job to pay for the medicine. I looked online to find at least 15 pages of withdrawal symptoms and over 30 pages to document the symptoms. When I started with the medicine it was pretty new and I guess they did not know about the withdrawal side effects.

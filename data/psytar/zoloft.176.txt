Initial side effects included period tremors, mainly in my hands, that went away after I had been on the med for a few weeks. Ongoing side effects include nausea (if I don't eat something with it), sleepiness, and difficulty achieving orgasm. Am taking this in combination with Wellbutrin, which counteracts the sexual side effects and the sleepiness. Overall I am delighted with the difference Zoloft has made for me in letting me lead a normal life, and I consider a bit of nausea to be quite worth it.

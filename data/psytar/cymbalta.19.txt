Uncontrolable crying, dark thoughts, exploded at anyone who looked at me wrong, gained 40+ pounds within 4 months. shall I continue? I never knew in a million years that I would be afraid of myself. What I mean is that during the 4 months I was taking Cymbalta, I almost took my life. I was on a different AD before this and the doctor switched it to this. After being hospitalized, my new doctor put me back on the previous AD which I can honestly say saved my life.

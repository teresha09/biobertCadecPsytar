Night Sweats, decreased sex drive, headaches, weight gain, fatigue, jaw clenching. I was on 20 mg a day for almost 2 years. The first year was great, other than a decreased sex drive. The 2nd year is when all the other symptoms started. I am waking up every night absolutely soaked in sweat (I can wring out my t-shirt and have drops of sweat coming out). I haven't had a good night's sleep in a year because of the night sweats.

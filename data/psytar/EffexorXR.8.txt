high blood pressure and high pulse. Though the literature says these are rare side effects, it happens. Before starting Effexor, my BP was 120/80, pulse 75. While on 225 mg Effexor, BP averaged 140/80 and pulse ranged from 85 to 105-resting rate! Lost 7 lbs the 3 months I was on it; must have sped up my metabolism too. These numbers only added to my anxiety.

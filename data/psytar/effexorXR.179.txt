Started so long ago. I hardly remember. With 300 mg, insomnia. Sweating is worse. NO weight gain. Some libido decrease. Much better than constant bickering with hubby and occasional temper tantrums where I threw and broke things :(. After being in a mental hospital for 3 days, was put on several different antidepressants which didn't work. Finally I was put on this and felt like my old self for the first time in 12 years. Was on 150mg until about 1 month ago. Had hysterectomy due to cervical cancer in Dec 04 and stopped taking my progesterone. Went back into severe depression. Now am on 300mg. Am definitely having difficulty sleeping but was able to wean off Xanax. Trying Neurontin for sleep now. Think the diagnosis of cancer plus going off my progesterone threw me into depression again. After reading other posts, will try taking in a divided dose or in the am to combat the insomnia.

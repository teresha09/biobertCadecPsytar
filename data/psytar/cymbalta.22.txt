Insomnia headaches nightmares. I started taking cymbalta 2 months ago. I have had nightmares about my car wrecking, drowning, not being able to move, my husband having an affair with my best friend, and a lot more. The nightmares make me not want to sleep. I have actually woke up and wanted to cry. And also sometimes I just can't sleep, I don't feel tired at bedtime (even though I was tired an hour before). I also have the worst headaches and while I have the headaches my right eye is blurry. And it hasn't helped my back pain at all

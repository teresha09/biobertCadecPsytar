First week; high, Second week; good mood, headaches, chest pains; third week; break through depression and fatigue, fourth week; still very tired, Doctor upped dose from 10 to 20mg and now I'm dreadfully zombie like. My brain is at a standstill. Kind of a relief from racing thoughts, but scary because I might as well be in a coma. I think it would be good in combination with a stimulant of some kind. I like not feeling depressed, but I feel like I am being made to feel happy against my will. It's like a false sense of peace. It is not the true sense of peace that comes from God. I think of this time of my life as taking a well needed break, That's what Lexapro is. a vacation from reality, Now I'll have to face withdrawl when it is time to get off the stuff, YIKES!

first 3-4 months I was doing great, then disrupted sleep began, waking up every hour, night sweats, craving for sugar, low motivation to do anything. I started on 30mg and went up to 60mg Couldn't tolerate 60mg, it rendered me completely sleepless and with metallic taste in my mouth. The cravings for sweets are annoying. I feel like a junkie. As of today I'm switching to Lexapro.

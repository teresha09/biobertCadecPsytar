weight gain. but so worth it. I have been on Lexapro for a while and my doctor took me off and switched me to Wellbutrin because I had gained 18 pounds in 2 months, BIG MISTAKE. I felt alive and clearheaded with Lexapro. I felt like a normal person. I even kept a clean house. With my depression everything stays jumbled up in my head and Lexapro helps me sort it all out. I LOVE LEXAPRO. Wellbutrin is making me mean, angry, nervous, anxious, suicidal, homisidal. I HATE WELLBUTRIN

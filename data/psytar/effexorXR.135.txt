Initially I had dizziness and some naseau. I found taking it at breakfast reduced nausea. I have found I sweat more on Effexor. No massive weight gain yet. Most annoying side effect is delayed orgasm and sex drive reduction. While the mind is still interested the body does not have the tingling all over like it used to before sex. Often get restless legs syndrome with Effexor. Appetite has improved but not to the point were I am emptying the pantry like their is no tomorrow. That is good! Some antidepressants make you so hungry. I just wish Effexor didn't stuff around with the sex drive.

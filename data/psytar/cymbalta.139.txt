feel good! I'm on day 5 and read all these posts before starting. I was previously on Paxil which was not effective. I feel good! I know its too soon, but I do not have any side effects, I feel more alert, focused and worry-free. I usually have very vivid dreams but I have slept well and have had calm dreams the last few nights. I do not feel "zombie-like" or tired, in fact I feel like I have more clarity and energy. I am on the low dose, 30mg daily. I don't see any correlation to this med and diarrea and I am not worried about the effects of "going off it" as I plan to "stay on it" as long as I feel this good. I have advice for those who still suffer: Get some sunshine on your face, just a few minutes will make you feel great. Get an old dog, not a puppy, an old dog that Needs you, that you can care for and that will love you back. If you can't handle a dog get a fish. Smile at a baby! They usually smile back at you :) Think of positive thoughts even if you have to make them up. I dare you! Buy something new even if its just a pair of underwear. Women know this really does work wonders. Give it a fair chance, good luck. Aloha~

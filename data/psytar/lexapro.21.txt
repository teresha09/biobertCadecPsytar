I had pain all over my body! My legs were the worst and my left leg felt like it was on fire! It hurt so bad, I ended up in the E,R. Because I thought that I might have a blood clot. The doctor told me that it was the Lexapro's side effects. my arms felt like needles are poking them, Felt like a knife in my shoulder, I got chills easily, felt like my legs were not getting enough circulation, it felt like my blood had carbonation in it! This is the most awful feeling! I am still having aches, pains, pins and needles throughout my entire body after being off of the Lexapro for a few days. I hope and pray it subsides. Please DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG! I would rather have panic attacks and be depressed than take another pill of Lexapro!

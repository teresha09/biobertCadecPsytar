Lethargy, low libido, dont want to do anything. I am very healthy and physically fit, Just started-only 2 37,5 mg. doses into it. Im going back to the Welbutrin which worked perfectly at 75mg a day, really gave me a lift and very little reduction in libido at that dose, which every doctor told me was ineffective, Rediculous-75mg (I break a 100 mg into 4 pieces) a day got me out of the house and energy, confidence. My doctor kept pushing me to try Effexor, but after reading all the terrible stories here Im quitting now. The positive reports here sound like they were written by drug reps. Im going back to Welbutrin, but dont let Dr. s tell you you have to take 300mg a day-that's crazy!

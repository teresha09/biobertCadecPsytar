Lethargic, body aches, migranes, Dr. prescribed 20mg daily. I take it at night. The first 2 days were great. I was feeling like my old self again, Then BOOM! I could not function. My mind was in a fog. I didn't care about anything. The headaches were unbearable. I have a problem with insomnia anyway so I haven't made a decision to start taking it in the morning yet. After finding this blog, I've been cutting my pills in half for the past 3 nites. I didn't feel as lethargic yesterday but didn't go to sleep until 3 a,m. I'm still unsure about this med. I've taken all the other anti-depressants over many years and couldn't stand the side effects. Email me with your suggestions, Please.

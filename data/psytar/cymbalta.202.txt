Withdrawal when missed dose. Exhaustion, horrible anxiety, crying, unable to work or function. Withdrawal symptoms always happened within 24 hours of missed dose. NOT recommended to skip or stop suddenly! Controls worst of my depression and anxiety. It seems side effects people report depend on the reason they are taking the medication.

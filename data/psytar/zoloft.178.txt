Night sweats but not sure it's from the Zoloft. I also didn't like the weird feelings when I first started so I took half doses until I got used to them and then moved to the full dose. I classify my life as "BZ" & "AZ" (before zoloft and after zoloft). I spent over sixty years depressed before. With zoloft I now know what "normal" life is like. But in addition to eliminating the depression it also eliminated the highs. (I used to consider myself a "mini manic depressive".) I take 100mg a day.

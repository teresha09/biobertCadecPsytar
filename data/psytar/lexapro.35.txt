extreme lethargy; hungry more than usual; weight gain; zero motivation; memory issues (short term memory negatively affected); hopeless; social anxiety magnified. I took 10 mg for one month and mainly noticed the fatigue as the biggest side effect, once I was upped to 20 mg though all of the other side effects seemed to take hold of my life. Not a good experience at all for me.

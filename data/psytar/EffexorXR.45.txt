The drug caused me to have NO sex drive and NO emotions. When I should have been crying, I had no desire. The side effects of coming off this drug are hell. Obviously I see this is a very addictive drug as far as withdrawl symptoms. Even tapering the drug, I have had SEVERE dizzines and SEVERE nausea. No one can prepare you the side effects when you decide to stop taking it. The Effexor did work for my depression while taking Lamictal. I felt great, but needed to try another anti-depressent to help with my sex drive.

During the first week I experienced hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia. Wasn't sure I was going to be able to continue but I went on the web and found out that those symptoms were normal and usually went away. I started feeling better around the fifth day. My only continuing side effects are total loss of appetite and continuing problems with insomnia. I take another medication to help me sleep. The appetite is not a concern because I am quite overweight, it has actually helped me lose 50 lbs over the last six months. Withdrawal symptoms are nothing to mess with I ran out of pills over a 4 day holiday weekend, and boy did I feel wierd. I have had recurring depressive episodes since childhood, and this is the second time I have tried anti-depressants. Prozac worked well the first time, but the same dose had no effect this time. I am also in cognitive behavioral therapy and I strongly recommend therapy in addition to medication.

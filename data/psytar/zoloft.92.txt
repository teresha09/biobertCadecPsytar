dry mouth, increased sweating, sexual problems (libido and ability). I was taking 200mg every morning, however I now only take 50mg as I am trying to get my sexual problems to improve. In addition, I am taking 300mg of wellbutrin, soon 450mg, and I am feeling sexual again. It has also helped me out of a deep depression that zoloft could not do. I love the extra energy! I also take klonopin 1mg 3 times daily.

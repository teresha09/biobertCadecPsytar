The only side effects I experienced were mild insomnia and extreme shakiness for the first 3 days. I was never one to take any kind of drugs. I would only take aspirin as a last resort. But I have to say that taking the Effexor has made me feel so much better. I read all the side effects and was reluctant to start it, but knew that I needed to take something in order to function in life. I am currently on 75 mgs per day and it has made a huge difference. My advice to anyone considering taking the drug is don't stress out when reading the side effects. All drugs effect people differently. Give it a chance. It took about 14 days for the drug to kick in. The side effects did go away after about 4 days and when I increased my dose from 37.5 mgs to 75 mgs I didn't have any side effects, My Dr. prescribed xanax for me to take along with the effexor for the first week which actually eliminated the shakiness and nervousness immediately. I only had to take the xanax for the first three days on the Effexor. I suggest that if you decide to take the Effexor, having the xanax on hand for the first few days will help. I have not had to increase my dosage as of yet. I'm hoping to be able to stay on the 75 mgs for as long as possible. Reading about the withdrawals is a little scarey, but like I said, all people are affected differently by different drugs, so I will cross that bridge if and when I get to it. Effexor has made a huge difference in my life and when and if I have to come off it, if I experience any withdrawals, well, so be it. It would be a small price to pay for being able to enjoy life.

Dizziness, nausea, headache, buzzing noise in head. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG. IT IS POISON. After taking 30 mg a day for 3 weeks, I stopped. I HAVE NEVER felt so awful as I do today. Started cying and laughing hysterically. Head is so mucked up I can barely move or think. Called doc and he said it's withdrawal. WTF, is this heroine or something? Withdrawal? I've stopped other SSRI's in the past and never experienced anything. This is bullshit. Do not take this poison.

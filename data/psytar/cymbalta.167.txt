When I first started Cymbalta (30mg) I had a major decrease in my appetite and a lot of trouble sleeping. By week three I felt better and was feeling less stressed and happier. I was without Cymbalta for about 4 days, and I felt horrible. I was very dizzy and sick to my stomach. I am fearful that it will be a difficult withdrawal process when the time comes to stop the medication.

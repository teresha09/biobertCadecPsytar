Initially went cycling like a yo-yo with mild mania and depression. Had to go up gradually from 12.5 mg every two weeks until I reached 200 mg in a YEAR. It was stimulating and I was hyper for a few months. This is the only SSRI that didn't give me gastric side effects. It felt stimulating and made me hyper for quite a while. However, having severe depression, I had no choice but to stick with it Slow titration helped a lot. Didn't have depression under control until I added Lithium 300 mg as adjunct. Now depression-free for 5 years or so. To avoid poop-out I have a day off a week.

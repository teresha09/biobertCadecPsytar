First three days of taking Lexapro to made my head feel like it was going to blow up. There was a lot of pressure, After that, day four was when I felt great. I couldn't be sad and I couldn't care about anything. It was a relief. - Most people don't start on 20mg, it was an emergency. If you have an "inner critic", it takes that voice away and you feel like you're allowed to feel happy again. - DO NOT STOP COLD TURKEY. I stopped after three months because I felt better. I gained ten pounds. The depression took about for months after to come back, Not pleasant. - Loved this drug, but if you don't like the feeling of uninterrupted calm. I don't recommend it. You aren't overly happy or overly sad, just stable.

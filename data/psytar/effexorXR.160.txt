At the very beginning of taking Effexor XR (75 mg) I had more energy, sweaty palms, jittery legs, hot flashes. After about two weeks, the side effects settled down and I thought I was doing alright. But then I felt almost the same as I did before Effexor XR. I started thinking maybe I had to increase my dose but then about a month and half before I went to see my psychiatrist, I started excercising a lot and now I feel great. I'm not going to change a thing but I think it was a combination of the Effexor XR, the summer starting, taking walks during my work days, and generally excercising more. I haven't had this much confidence and self esteem in so long. I can finally talk to my best friends like I used to and I can't tell you how good that makes me feel! I feel like myself again, and I'll tell ya, it's been close to 10 years!

weight gain and jaw clenching. The first 3 weeks of Zoloft (25mg), the anxiety had pretty much subsided (the clenched feeling in my chest was gone! what a relief!) but no real difference (some good days some bad days) with the depression. Moved up to 50mg. At the end of 6 weeks I still felt no difference but my best friend and boyfriend both said they noticed a difference and that I seemed to take things in stride better. Moved up to 75mg. Here- sometimes I felt more depressed, lethargic, and would get upset at things that normally wouldnt upset me, or felt too "whatever happens is fine" Went back down to 50mg 2x a week, 25mg5x a week. Slowly I noticed my mood feeling better. Feeling happier. More easy going. Also, my feeling of being able to trust others improved (guess I had mild paranoia that I didnt know I had). I love the effects of this med, except that now I am noticing weight gain (7lbs in last 2 mo.) thats not coming off with diet and exercise, so I am switching to Wellbutrin SR, and hopefully will have success with my mood and get back to a body fat % I am happy with. It gets a "4" because of weight gain and how long it took to work (2 months). Otherwise, it's a 5.

Nausea at first, started out at 60mg Also on Topomax x2 a day, and Seroquel 50mg at night. Then as time went over the past few months, since no improvement in depression Doctor upped dose to 120mg, I feel more like an emotional zombie. Depression and fatigue still there. Emotionally and sexually flat-lined. Just kind of existing day by day. Had lost 50lbs on my own dieting prior to meds and now gained back 30lbs which adds to my feeling down. No thoughts of suicide just deeper depression. Explained to the doctor it wasn't helping to begin with 1 month after taking it so upped the dose on me and its done nothing to really help pick me up at all. My fatigue and down time is still present, no suicide thoughts but just NO enjoyment in anything. I'm slowly gaining back weight I struggled very hard to lose and its driving me even more down in the dumps.

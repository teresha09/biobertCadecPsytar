THE ONLY SIDE EFFECTS I EXPERIENCED WAS PROBLEMS REACHING ORGASM. I WAS HAVING CHEST PAINS, MY BREATHING WAS SO MESSED UP THAT I WAS HYPERVENTALATING ALL THE TIME NOT TO MENTION PANIC ATTACKS. THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE UNTIL I STARTED TAKING CYBALTA. TRIED TAKING EFFEXOR, BUSPAR, ZOLOFT, TRAZADONE, XANAX AND NONE OF THEM WORKED UNTIL I STARTED TAKING CYBALTA. WITHIN 4 DAYS IT STARTING WORKING. CHEST PAINS STARTED TO GO AWAY, MY BREATHING RETURNED TO NORMAL, WASNT CONSTANTLY WORRYING ABOUT MY HEALTH AND NOW AFTER 3 WEEKS OF TAKING IT I FEEL GREAT.

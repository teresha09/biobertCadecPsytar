Sexual dysfunction, no orgasm, very low libido, persistent brain fog. I went to doctor for my acid reflux and as it turned out he prescribed this poison to me without even telling me what this shit is and what does it do to my body. i have stopped taking sertraline for 4 days now and the side effects haven't worn off yet.

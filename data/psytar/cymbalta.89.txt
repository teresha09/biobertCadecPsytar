Brain shocks in the beginning with insomnia. Loss of appetite, and more thirsty than usual. Decrease in Libido. I went on Cymbalta for my Depression/Fibromyalgia. I also have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome so my Dr. was hoping it would lift my depression and help me to regulate my sleep cycle and get up earlier in the morning. Ever since I have been on it, I have not had one good night sleep. I wake up about every two hours and am very restless throughout the night. I have also had night sweats on a few occasions. There were times where it made me feel even more anxious than I already was. The one thing I did notice is it controlled my ruminating which was a bit of a relief. However, I felt no better in regards to my depression. Now I have to go through the hell of withdrawl for another two weeks. I would not recommend this medication for anyone who has a sensitive system like me. Unfortunately, I did not find much benefit!

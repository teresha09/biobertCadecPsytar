complete indifference towards sex, inability to get an erection, severe pain in my right jaw, headache, nausea, an odd gag reflex when I yawned, insomnia, feeling of being "strung out". Cymbalta did what I needed it to, for the most part-it gave me concentration, the ability to stay awake, and improved my mood greatly. However, the side effects were too severe; I was taking 30mg I could not endure the total impotence and feared a permanent sexual effect, and I never once felt sleepy while on the medicine. I also just felt. weird.

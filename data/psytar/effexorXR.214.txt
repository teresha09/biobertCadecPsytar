only side effects i go through is if i forget to take the daily dose . go off with the fairies - light & dizzy & cannot concentrate at all & get BAD BAD Withdrawals. Was second in charge of big motor company for 23 years when i got anxienty / depression , eventually couldn't function etc & ended in a heap , was on & off many different types of drugs & then 2 years later ended up in mental hospital . they took me off everything & started me on EFFEXOR XR. within a month i was starting feeling a lot better & then started working a part time job about 2 years later which i still do today. If it wasn't for Efexor Xr i wouldn't be here today . i have tried many times to slowly come off it with no success. For quality of life & my family i have decided to stay on it . I was in a bad place for about 5 years all up & i never want to go back there. EFFEXOR XR is good shit as far as i am concerned

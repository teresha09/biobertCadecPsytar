Brain zaps; grinding my teeth; night sweats; constant shaking of my hands and limbs; not being able to stop my Head going into tremours; insomnia; constant fatigue; headaches; hair falling out; forgetfulness; sore jaw etc - you name it I got them all badly ! I think it is the worst thing I have ever taken - for almost a year I have tried to take it hinking it would help or blaming my body for the effects and now I have come to realise it is this drug / poison. I think people should be warned and that surely after all the blogs about Cymbalata that are negative that the Testing results of this drug should be investigated. Some blogs have hundreds of negative comments - something doesn't smell right - how did this pass clinical trials ? I am now trying to wean off it am in my second week of hell.

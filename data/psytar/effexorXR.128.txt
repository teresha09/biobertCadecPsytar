At first, side effects were pretty numerous. vivid dreams, night sweats, loss of appetite, nausea, etc After a few months, the only problem I've really had is headaches. I've read so many negative comments about this drug but it has really worked well for me. I was depressed for years but left it untreated. Tried Zoloft first but had no reaction. I honestly felt better after taking Effexor for only a few days. I can live with a few side effects as long as it cures my depression. :-)

suicidal/homicidal hopeless thoughts, irrational broke a tooth grinding them incessantly, erratic menstrual periods, intense dreams that I could not tell from reality and could not wake from. Sleepiness and bouts of sleeplessness extreme lethargy developed diabetes type II high blood pressure and was hospitalized twice when trying to ween off of the drug. No one ever told me even as I was seeing my psych and psychologists weekly, and my physician, that what I was experiencing could be from the drug. They just said I was severely mentally ill and needed hospitalized and more and more medication. At my second involuntary hospitalization I refused all psych meds and miracle of all miracles I FINALLY GOT BETTER. 5 months drug free and no more hospitalizations ps both my psychiatrist and my psychologist dropped me during my last hospitalization. Said I was too severely ill for them to help me, NICE! But I've gotten better ever since.

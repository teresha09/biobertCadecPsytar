Slight nausea after taking the pill but nothing noticable after that. I was on a large dose of Zoloft a few years back and it made me feel like a zombie. Now I take a small dose of Lexapro and feel much happier and normal than I used to in addition to having little to no side effects. It really helped a lot, though my anxiety is still present it is not crippling like it used to be.

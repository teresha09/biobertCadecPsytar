increased resting heart rate, loss of appetite in the beginning but went back to normal after 2 months, mild constipation, vivid dreams when dosage was increased to 150mg, difficult to wake up but more energy when awake. the first time i used effexor was 4 years ago and it caused me to lose about 10 pounds, but i became pregnant and switched to zoloft. do not wean off effexor too soon as i had one very bad day and experienced mild halloucinations

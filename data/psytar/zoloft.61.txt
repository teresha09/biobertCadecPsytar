had a very strange reaction to this drug, one which some people also seem to experience. If you have ever taken amphetamine (Dexedrine) you will know what I mean. I got very speedy and high off of this drug in addition to feeling standard SSRI effects. However, these speedy effects completely negate any sexual side effects and if anything will improve your sex life, making it great if you find SSRI's sexual side effects distressing. I found this drug to not do much in the way of improving my anxiety problem, although it did work very well on depression. The "speed" side effect was very unusual, and I could see it casuing addiction in some people. This is a great, fairly mild drug with few long-term side effects if your symptoms are depression-specific.

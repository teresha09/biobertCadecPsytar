Nausea, a lil. brain "zapping" pressure, restless jaw (teeth wanting to grind) and HAPPINESS. Ive only been on it for 1 day and was a little naucious this morning and my jaw has been wanting to clench down. I started 37.5mg and in a week Ill be jumping to 75mg I was so scared to take it that I delayed it because I read all the comments on this site. So I finally made to decision to start it and hope for the best and it seems like not too many side effects are going to get me. Haha. Im excited to start this drug and pray for a normal life once again. Ive had a miscarriage with twins and full term pregnancy in the past 1 1/2 year, husband in the Marine Corps always gone and lots of moving. I pray that this helps and I can overcome my depression and anxiety. Ill make another rating in a month, hope this helps someone

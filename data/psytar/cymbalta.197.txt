ACCELERATED weight gain, initial night sweats, initial sleepiness. After trying all others, this drug has given me a sense of calm and feeling of contentedness that I never knew others lived with Unfortunately, I also experienced drastic wieght gain of 25 lbs within 6 months and it is still going. I am naturally very thin and this part is driving me crazy! The dr. says losing all that nervous energy has slowed my metabolism(?). He has given me a prescription for Topomax to counter effects. I would hate to stop the cymbalta but have gone up 3 pant sizes!

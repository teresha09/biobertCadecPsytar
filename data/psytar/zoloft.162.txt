Dry mouth, heightened side effects if more than one day's dose was missed (aggression, agitation, restlessness, mood swings) but not severe enough to quit taking it long term. I was on 100 mg for 3 1/2 years when it quit working as well as it had been. It was still helping, just not enough. I was taken off Zoloft and put on Seroquel. Big mistake! I suffered from extreme aggression, agitation, mood swings, and I was unable to feel peace or happiness. I wound up cutting my arm 3 times and needed 31 stitches! I suffered from a mental brake down after 5 weeks of being on the Seroquel and when I had to stay at a mental facility they put me back on Zoloft and increased my dose to 150mg. I was like a new person! I was the 'old', good me again and I have been better ever since. If the Zoloft stops 'working' then increase your dose before trying something else and risk having an adverse reaction like I did. Zoloft can be taken up to 350mg and still be safe, so if it has ever worked for you, please give a higher dose a try.

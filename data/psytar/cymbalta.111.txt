Nausea and stomach cramping the first couple of days; was somewhat better if I ate small amounts of food frequently. It also made me very hungry when I first started it and whenever I increased dosage. I have found Cymbalta to be helpful in reducing my anxiety, but not as effective for my chronic depression. Before, I was starting to drink a glass or 2 of wine at night to reduce my anxiety. Now I don't feel any need to drink to reduce anxiety anymore. As for depression, I took prozac years ago, and found that much more effective in eliminating my depression. But Prozac also raised the threshold on other feelings, which I didn't like. Cymbalta seems to have a lower threshold in terms of blocking feelings. So I still get the good feelings, which I like, but unfortunately I also still get the depression. For perimenopause, at first it seemed to help reduce the emotional over-reacting. But it seems less effective in doing so lately.

Nausea, weight loss in beginning. 0% sex drive, difficulty sleeping, nightmares, profuse sweating. For the 1st. time on med in 1993 it worked great for me for about 2 years. 2nd time on med in 1999 it seemed to not even touch my anxiety/depression. The nightmares and seeing things at night made me opt for another med. Effexor XR 150 mgs. has worked wonders on me.

GAS,vivid dreams, some muscle twitches. mosy of my side effects were in the first week or so starting effexor xr and whenever the dosage is raised, i experienced extreme headaches was extremely tired, very nausous, no appetite,a mild "high" feeling no sex drive mainly because i was way to tired. all those side effects went away though after a couple weeks and now it just makes me really gassy and i think my vision has become a little more blurry, the gas is very innoying though even at night when im in bed with my boyfriend its really uncomfortable but i took an over the counter pill for gas relief and it seemed to work. i havnt noticed that much of a change in my anxiety. its took the edge off i dont have panic attacks really anymore but i still cant sleep at night and i still get very nervous when its unessecarymaybe a dosage increase is needed but i was on zoloft a few years ago and it made me feel like a zombie so in comparison its alot better i hope things work out.

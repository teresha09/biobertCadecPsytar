Night sweats, interrupted sleep most nights, seriously dry mouth when I wake up. These I can tolerate. But the wooziness! It's somewhere between dizzy and light headed. It's not particularly painful, but it is frequent and uncomfortable. On the other hand, I am functioning again. 8 years on SSRIs. Was taking Lexapro which was much like taking nothing. Could barely function and was in danger of losing my job. Switched to EffexorXR for the addition of norepinephrine. Definitely have more energy, but still not enough. May increase dosage again, but I'm concerned about the wooziness.

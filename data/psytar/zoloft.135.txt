None at first, but over time I realized 1) I had gained 50 lbs in the last 3 years, 2) I had anxiety attacks that I previously never had , 3) Restless Leg Syndrome, 4) Sweaty and HOT nearly all of the time. 5) Still had several months during the year when I was fatigued and too tired to function. I stopped taking Zoloft because I was still having several months out of the year when I felt like it wasn't helping - I had no motivation and just wanted to sleep all day. Plus, in the last year, I experienced anxiety attacks more frequently which slowly created phobias I never had before. The last straw was feeling hot all of the time. People look at you strange when you wear short sleeves in 40 degree weather. ;) HOWEVER, it did help a majority of the time, especially in the first 2 years. It helped get rid of the depression yet I still felt completely myself - not like a zombie at all. It was mild enough that I could switch the dosages when I had a bad "phase" (maybe SAD?) without any immediate side effects. Thought it was a miracle drug at first! Unfortunately, the side effects began to be too much for it to be worth it. Currently in the process of switching over to Wellbutrin XL.

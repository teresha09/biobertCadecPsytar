Only fatigue and sexual side effects while taking it, during withdrawal I have shortness of breath, dizziness, light headedness, brain zaps, bouts of nausia, sweating, very strange dreams, some nightmares, mood swings, and lots of drowsiness. I know this drug has helped some people, but I only hope you know about the withdrawal before you go on it. I trusted my doctor of 13 years and just started taking it on her recommendation. I was only mildly depressed and had I known then what I know now about the withdrawals I never would have taken this. I have missed so much work because I can't even drive most days, let alone function in an office. I went from 75mg to 37.5 mg for a week, then 37.5mg every other day for 2 weeks . what a roller coaster that was . good day, bad day, good day, etc. I have been completely off for 3 days and have had NO improvement in my withdrawal symptoms. I am so miserable at this stage that I'm worse off than when I started taking this by far. I wish you all the best.

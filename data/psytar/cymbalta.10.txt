Was on Prozac 20mg and it was making me more depressed. So my Dr switched me to 60 mg of Cymbalta. Took my first pill at night went to sleep not thinking about it at all because I knew it could take weeks before it started working. About 1 a. m I jolted up out of bed. My heart was racing I was cold and hot at the same time. Couldn't catch my breath. Was very scary felt disoriented. Came to hospital and they gave me something to reverse it. The Dr at hospital said that was a very common effect with Cymbalta.

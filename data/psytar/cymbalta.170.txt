Loose stools, gas, some fatigue soon after dose. If I miss a dose-irritability with long and vivid dreams. This medication definitely stabilizes me, but I'm concerned by how quickly my mood goes out of control with brain zaps when I go even 36 hours without a dose. Withdrawal is much worse than the condition I'm treating!

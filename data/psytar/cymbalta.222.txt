First week - Nausea, dizziness, no appetite. First month - sleeplessness. After that, just teeth grinding. I take a low dose of klonapin for that. Sexually, I'm stronger then ever. I know there are a lot of nay sayers out there. I work with my doctor and trust him very much. I've suffered from GAD for quite a long time, and this drug works wonders. Things that I would obsess over before no longer are a concern. The only issues I have, not really side effects, is that its a little harder to get out of bed in the morning, and some constipation. They are not side effects that ruin my life or change it in anyway, so I didn't mention them.

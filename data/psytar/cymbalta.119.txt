Short term: dizziness,nausea,confusion, and headaches for about 10 days or so. Long term: extremely graphic nightmares, night sweats(especially in winter), 30 lb. weight gain, sexual side effects, extremely unhappy with all of these side effects. I feel somewhat more stable than when off of this type of medicine, but I am also so unhappy with the long term side effects. Also, I am still experiencing some major depressive episodes and invasive thoughts, which makes me question if the cure is worse than the disease. I want to get off of it, but I fear feeling the way I did prior to taking any antidepressant, which was horrible. Others taken include Paxil and Lexapro. I am at a real crossroad right now and don't know what to do. Help?

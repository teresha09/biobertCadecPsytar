Occasional dryness of mouth & constipation at first. Slept like a baby. No real mood change, but decision making became a lot easier. Rapid heart beat at times. Felt calmer, but also had less energy. Some blurriness of vision which I didn't attribute to the medicine until I went off 2 wks. ago. Mild headaches. Lightheadedness. Low dose (20 mg) One weird side effect I had was an occasional feeling of heaviness in my calves that gradually increased and became painful, almost like the blood was pooling in my legs. Discontinued medication, using Motrin to pre-empt headaches. Still feel lightheaded now & then. Next: Wellbutrin(energy) or nothing.

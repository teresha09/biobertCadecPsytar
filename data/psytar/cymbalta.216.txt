was sleepy had alot of stomach problems first week. it caused some insominia, i also felt like i was haviing brain buzz and ringing in my ears. I have hung in there and now the side effect have gone. I am feeling wonderful now. I have not felt like this in years. I am playing with my kids and smiling and laughing everyone can tell. I am cleaning and organizing my house now. I feel like a person. I have to take alot of meds. I have no insurance and my cymbalta is $185.00 a month. I am also on neurotin, tramadol, benazapril for my blood pressure and glyberide for my diabetes. They have not caused any problems yet with the cymbalta. My meds cost about $800.00 all togther. It is hard to buy sometimes. I am a homemaker and i have four little girls. I have been so depressed for the past 2 years and have not been myslef at sll. but now with the cymbalta I have started acting like my old self. i love it. My happy pill. Some of the other meds I take also effects and raises serotonin levels so that may make a difference. But whatever is going on in my brain is wonderful. Everyone who reads this if you have any suggestions on how to get samples or discount on meds please email me at  Pray for me and everyone in that can not afford there meds. It is a big problem i think in the economy. Lets all remeber to pray for our country and the economy. There is power in numbers and all our prayers can make a difference.

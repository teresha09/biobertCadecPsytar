increased anxiety was the worst thing for me, but it went way down on day 4 or 5)  loose stool for 2 weeks, headache for 5 days, restless legs first 2 weeks. Overall not too bad comparing to LEXAPRO and previous paranoid state of mind. LOL. This is a second time I take Zoloft. I was on it for 1 year and than I succesfully weaned off with very mild withdrawal. After about 6 month all my anxiety returned and now I'm on it again. I'm very thankfull that there is help like zoloft out there. I was really affraid to take zoloft even though I took it before but good think I did. If I you have any questions what so ever dont hesitate to e-mail me. I would love to help.

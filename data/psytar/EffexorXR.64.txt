felt like i was inside screaming and nobody could hear me, teeth grinding, sweating like mad, hot hot hot, weight gain, headaches and general feeling of tiredness. At first it was ok, and then once i got on the 75 mg a day, it really changed, nausea feeling, hadache, no sex drive. i felt as if i needed to be doing something all of the time. i lowered my own dose to everyother day and on those days i take it i can physically see the difference, my husband says i look worried, great! i am type A personality and am in the public eye alot, but since on this i do not want to go out anywhere and i surely don't want to do my job, so i must get off of this and try something else.

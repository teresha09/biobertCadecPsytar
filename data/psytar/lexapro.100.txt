Woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't fall back asleep. Called in sick to work because I was feeling dizzy and nauseous, sweaty hands, decreased appetite, numbness in the back of my head, sore neck, keep feeling like I need to stretch, feeling disconnected, at the same time got a body buzz and an overall calm feeling. Felt tired and slow all day. Taking it a day at a time.

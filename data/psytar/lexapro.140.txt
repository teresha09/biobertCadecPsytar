All these happened the day of my first pill: Light headed, Dizzy, Extreme tiredness, Diarrhea, Jaw muscles tightening & clenching, Stuffy nose, migraine, Foggy, Zoning/trancelike, Apathy, Cold & chills, Trouble focusing eyes, Confusion, Nausea, Jaw clenching, Sweaty palms, Time/space discontinuity, Cant catch my breath, Tiredness or energetic, Memory loss, Tremors & twitching, Yawning, disorientation, Convulsions, 10mg. I stopped after the 2nd day, but restarted on day 4 with half a pill (5mg). Day 6 I went to 10mg. The side effects were severe, but diminished as time passed, and have become tolerable within 2-3 months. For me it became a question of balance: Lexapro side effects vs. depression and its side effects. After 1 1/2 years on Lexapro, I believe that it has a very short shelf life, less than 30 days, and is extremely sensitive to temperature/humidity fluctuations & extremes, Every month, when I'm down to my last 3-8 pills of my supply, I notice that I get depressed often and have sudden mood swings. This is consistent every month. When I start a 'new' 30 day batch of pills, I go through minor side effects for a few days. I'm a stay-at-hme-dad of toddler & infant and am glad that I'm not depressed with anxiety while raising them, That said, I can't wait until I'm ready to stop, WEIGHT GAIN: 6,7%

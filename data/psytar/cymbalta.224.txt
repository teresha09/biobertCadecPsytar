Delayed ejaculation, vivid dreams. I currently take 40 mg of Cymbalta a day. It has GREATLY reduced my level of anxiety and depression. At first I had some minor sexual side effects (no problems with erection, but I did have delayed ejaculation), but those side effects disappeared after a few months. The only side effect that I have now is extremely realistic/vivid dreams. The best comparison I can make about the dreams, is if a "normal" dream is like watching a dvd on a 13 inch screen, then a dream on Cymbalta is like going to see an IMAX movie The dreams aren't bad though. just more interesting. Plus, I'm better able to remember my dreams after I wake up.

This has worked great for me. I started on 75mg, then went up to 150mg and then 300mg a day. The only side effects I get is night sweats. I did lose weight on effexor. It could be a coincidence. Dr said some people eat more when they're happy and some eat less so that's probably why some people put on weight while others lose while on effexor. I'm on the slow decrease. I'm on 225mg a day now. I have noticed my mood to be lower and more mad lately. Am taking very slowly to get off. I'm not sure why i'm even getting off it, my mum is keen for me too cause she reckons it's bad long term, But Dr's tell me there's no evidence for that.

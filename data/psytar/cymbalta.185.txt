 Despite its side effects, I find cymbalta the best choice for Depression, Anhedonia and Insomnia due to GAD. My GAD controlled my life since I couldn't handle any stressful situation but thanks to duloxetine I can have a normal life again I enjoy playing videogames/watching movies again. I can go out with friends again without suffering extreme anxiety I can sleep at night easily and naturally Overall it's a very good drug. It only takes 1-2 weeks to work By the way, if you want to quit this med there is only one way: Opening pills and removing a few micro-capsules every 2 weeks (let's say 20 micro-capsules). You won't even notice

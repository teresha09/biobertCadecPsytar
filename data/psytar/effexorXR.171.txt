Loss sex drive; weight gain; night sweats; nightmares; muscle twitches and jerky when sleeping; ( miss a dose i get depression or panic attack- sometimes withdraw symptoms). I take Effexor with the combination of YAZ for PMDD and it has worked for the best. I don't want to switch medicines again since I have been on quite a few- Prozac, Zoloft and Lexapro and also I am afraid of what the withdraw symptoms would be like.

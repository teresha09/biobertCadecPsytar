Extreme fatige,sweating,nightmares and that was just the beginning. The thoughts of suicide were overwhelming and it made me feel a horrible despair. Mood swings,extreme anger,leg pain just to name a few. I didnt take cymbalta for long because it was turning me into a worse basket case than I already was. One thing I did experience when trying to get off it was mood swings. Some of which were very angry outbursts,an anger I never felt before. Lost the love of my life because of it. Now taking 100 mg. of Zoloft and feeling so much better. I would not recommend cymbalta to anyone.

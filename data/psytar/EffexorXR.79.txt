Low sex drive/cloudy head/unable to lose weight. I have been completely off of Effexor for about 2 weeks now. It has been a nightmare. I would like to say to people that are thinking about taking this med. to really look at the side effects of withdrawal. for some it is different. but it has been a nightmare for me. this drug didnt really work that well for me to come off this hard. it feels like someone else is in your body. feels like you have the flu x 100 constantly for 2 weeks now I cant work, cant go to school, can't function. I have tried to take vitamins omega 3 6 and 9) nothing is working to make me feel better you honestly feel like a walking zombie. omega 3 6 and 9) nothing is working to make me feel better you honestly feel like a walking zombie. My hair has been falling out, my under eyes are so black from being so weak. my body feels like jello. I will never ever recommend this drug to anyone. let alone take effexor again. knowing what i know now. i would have never ever put this into my body.

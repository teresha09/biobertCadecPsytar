Very sleepy, would doze off at work at my desk and during meetings. Weight gain. VERY vivid dreams to the point of not really knowing what I dreamt and what really happened. Helped the depression only quit taking it because it affected my job (the sleepiness) think it may have helped the anxiety, I remember I was able to cut back on my dosage of xanax.

Neck stiffness and pain, Headache, Muscle pain in legs and lower back, Difficult sleep. I just wanted to report on day 1 of use and will continue to update as I go. Anxiety was greatly decreased within one hour of taking medication. I did feel that I needed to slow down and take it easy due a general sense of instability.

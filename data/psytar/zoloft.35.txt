At first it was great. I had some minor gastrointestinal issues. But lately I have feel like it is not working any longer. I am tired, have headaches, and don't really want to take it anymore. I worry about the side effects. I am concerned about side effects that I will have when I stop taking it. I know I have to consult my physician.

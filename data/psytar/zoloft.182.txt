For the first couple weeks I was very tired, felt lethargic at times and more anxious at others. I also had an irrational fear that this drug was going to cause me to 'lose my mind' or have some other horrible side effect that SOOO many people write about on-line. I stuck with it, and I am very glad I did. It has been 4.5 months and have had no adverse side effects from Zoloft. I am only on 25 mgs, but I feel it is working for me. I have way more energy, actually crave social situations, when before I preferred solitude, I have a sex drive, and more confidence.

People who the drug is working for (like myself), would rather be out enjoying our lives than on the computer writing about Zoloft. But I

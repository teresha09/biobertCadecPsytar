Catatonic, no emotion. Severe palpitations and irregular heartbeat. Stopped taking it and two weeks later still irregular. Seeking cardiovascular treatment. It DID help combat fatigue. I was able to function physically like a normal human being again for the first time in years, but I had no emotion whatsoever.

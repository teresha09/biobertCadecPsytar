mild nausea and stomach upset, mild headache. I have suffered severe pain, numbness and tingling in my left arm, severe pain in my left leg for more than 5 years. Nothing else has ever relieved it. After 2 weeks on this drug, the pain is gone. I am also free of anxiety and my depression is lifting. I'm like a new person. Thank God for Cymbalta!

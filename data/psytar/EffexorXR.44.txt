tired all the time, no sex drive, unable to reach orgasm, didn't care about a thing, And, if you think the side effects are hell, just wait until you try and go off it,  OMG, the nightmares, the insane DIZZINESS, the brain "SHOCKS" . I wanted to die. Took me over a month to get rid of the withdrawal. I WOULD NEVER TAKE THIS EVIL DRUG AGAIN. The depression wasn't as bad as the drug !

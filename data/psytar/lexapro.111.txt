a day and a half of nausea . that's it. I suffered from depression since high school but was able to function very well/my feelings got hurt easily and my depression worsened before my period/over the last two years my depression became a daily hindrance with a lot of crying and negative thinking. I never took any meds and was scared to death to start/but I did (5mg)/after two days, my feelings improved greatly/bad things just slide off my back/I feel like a new person

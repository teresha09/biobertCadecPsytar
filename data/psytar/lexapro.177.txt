Weight gain; supressed sex drive; lots of sleeping. I take 40mg a day with 3mg klon. I think the combo makes me itch all over. Its been doing this for about a year. I think the Lexapro helps a lot but it seems like something is still lacking in my mental/emotional state. Like it almost works great most of the time but something is still missing for it to be just right. maybe it never will but Im hopeful. Ive increased to 50mg but it didnt really seem to make a difference, so I tried 60)  That put me right over the edge. So 40 seems to work best for me. Anyone else take lexapro with a klonopin combo that seems to have funny side effects?

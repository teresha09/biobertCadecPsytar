Racing brain, not sleep well, dry mouth, sexual disfunction, bad memory, bad dreams, endless energy. All medicines have side effects! it is how it effects the individual in different ways. Up until now I have been taking Endep for the pain and neuropathy and Citropalapram for depression. These drugs both had similar side effects to Cymbalta and hard to withdraw from with bad withdrawal symptoms the only difference is the Endep knocked me out at night and I slept well, only very drousy and tired during the day, sexual disfunction just the same. So I figure in my mind that having one tablet to take and only pay for just one lot of medication ($34.20Aud) has to have a plus and only one set of side effects and withdrawal symptoms to cope with is even more a plus. By the way, with Citropalapram had endless energy for the first year or so then just felt worn out and tired after that. Having said that also, it saved my life as I was so bad before taking the drugs all I wanted to do was die to stop the dark depression and pain, so I think I have done well.

Loss of sex drive; massive weight gain, forgetfulness. I would not be here today if it weren't for Lexapro. I took this because I began to have severe panic attacks and issues with depression. I started at 10mg. I went up to 20mg and found I was putting on a lot of weight. There are down sides to it, but this medication helped me through a very, very tough time in my life.

Irritability, extreme hosility if I went up on higher doses. It worked for my anxiety for a year and then it stopped. I have no idea why. It just stopped. It wasn't really helpful for my depression, but then again none of the SSRIs were. It didn't have any effect on my sex drive surprisingly. I stopped taking it several months ago but I thought it would be good to share this experience.

Trouble Staying asleep for more than 2hrs at a time. Loss of appetite (good side effect) weird, lucid dreams, night sweats. All side effects went away except the dreams, Unfortunately. I developed another side effect after the ones I mentioned above disapeared. When I forget to take my medication I get vertigo immediately after I miss my dose and often I get massive headaches. All in all. I love it. I have not have a depressed moment since I've been on it, approx, 8 months. The side effects caused by missing a dose are easily managed by taking my missed dose. I can live with them.

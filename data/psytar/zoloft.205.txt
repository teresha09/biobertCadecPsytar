For the first 1-2 weeks, my neck felt very tired and sore. After the first two weeks, I felt like a new person entirely. I don't feel numb to emotions at all; when I'm sad, I'm still sad. When I'm happy, I'm fantastic. Still living my life with all of the ups and downs, but I feel centered and normal. With an anti-depressant you MUST taper to your dose (I. e. Taking half of a pill for a week, then taking a whole pill afterwards.) if you don't do this, you may have a terrible time. Also, it takes at 2 wks-1 mo. for you to really feel the effects, so try and be patient!

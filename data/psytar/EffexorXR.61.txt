Please do not take this drug, I started taking it for depression and after just 5 days my hair has fallen out at the front I now have a huge bald patch. It should be banned. One of the side effects is Alopecia. I have thick long dark hair and am devastated, Horrible drug. I have since read a lot and found many people experiencing hair loss, some now are having to wear hair pieces or wigs.

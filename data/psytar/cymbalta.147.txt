Yawning, which subsided after a few weeks. Itching, which comes and goes. Vivid dreams, which can be rather interesting. Decreased appetite, which is rather nice. Diarrhea, which can be extremely annoying, but I am figuring ways to minimize it (taking it on a full stomach is helping). This medication has changed my life for the better. I felt its positive effects within a day or two, and pressed through the initial side effects because I was so encouraged by the anti-depressive features. After one week on 30mg, my MD increased my dosage to 60mg This did not help me! My condition deteriorated rapidly, at which point my doctor wanted to increase the dosage further. I insisted that 30mg was working wonders, and he reluctantly prescribed a 2 week course at 30mg Well, that's where I've remained for 3 months now. I'm very glad that I persisted with my opinion regarding the dosage. The doctor still claims that 30mg is not even considered a therapeutic dose, but I know what works. I do continue to have digestive issues with Cymbalta, but through trial and error, am learning to minimize this. Taking it mid-day on a full stomach seems to be working for me most days.

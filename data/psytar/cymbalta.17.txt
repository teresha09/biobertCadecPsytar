Typical side-effects as body/brain adjusted but my issues are associated with discontinuing this medication. Horrible withdrawal ! My Dr. didn't address the issue when he prescribed this medicine and when I told him I didn't want to take it any longer, he said only, "skip a day in between doses for a couple of weeks" to discontinue. I skipped 1 day and got so sick, I was constantly nauseated, gagging, and threw up for three days which caused me to loose the capsule (in the toilet) on the days I was suppose to take it. I have very significant issues with thermo-regulation which leads to a feeling of burning, followed by profuse sweating. I have brain zaps that feel like electrical shocks and result in jerking and spasms. The overwhelming fatigue is almost as bad as the vomiting. I have been dizzy and now as I progress into withdrawal, I am becoming more agitated, negative and morose. I decided to quit trying to "skip a day" and now open the capsule and divide the beads in half, assuming that I am reducing my dose to 15 MG/day. This is nasty-nasty stuff and I would not recommend it to anyone. I am so thankful that I decided to dis-continue now rather than waiting until I had been on it for over a year or taking a higher dose.

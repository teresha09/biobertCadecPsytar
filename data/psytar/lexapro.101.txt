At 10mg/day for 2 months, my depression persisted and my doctor increased me to 20mg/day. For the entire time I've been taking Lexapro, I've had no sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and only three orgasms during intercourse. Prior to that I was having one or more orgasms per week with my wife of 19 years. This was only acceptable because my depression symptoms went away,completely. I've only had a slight reduction in my ability to concentrate. My doctor dropped me down to 10mg/day today and I'm taking it at night, DON'T STOP TAKING IT WITHOUT A PLAN. I was away on travel and was without for five days. First two days,no problem. Day three I was very anxious. Days four and five were hell. I was like a squirrel on crack,no sleep, couldn't concentrate, metallic taste in mouth, JAW WENT NUMB! It was horrible. I feel like I've been chemically neutered.

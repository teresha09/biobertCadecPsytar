Memory loss, sweating. I started taking 50 mg per day after a car accident that left me with a back injury. I am now up to 200 mg per day of Zoloft and I can say I no longer dwell on certain things, but I worry about other things more. I have a high tolerence to meds, I also take 2000-3000 mg lortab per day for pain and it just barely takes the edge off. I also take flexeril 4 times a day and take 10mg of Ambien nightly to sleep, and a blood pressure pill daily (I am not overweight). Even with all this I function normally & I am self employed, which is extremely stressful. No one who knows me would ever believe I take this much medication! I would love to say Zoloft is a life saver but it only slightly helps me. If I miss a dose though, I feel like I have little lightening strikes in my head. Overall, it does help some, but I have not tried to come off of it, YET!

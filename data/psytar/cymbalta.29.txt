Extreme fatigue, drowsiness and a 5lb weight gain within the first 2 months. 15 months later I'd gained 30 lbs, had horrible withdrawal effects each time I tried to come off of it including nausea, dizziness, fatigue, etc I finally had a dr help me wean off 7 months ago and since that time the depression has become worst than ever w/ suicidal thoughts at times, major irritability, lack of concentration, and a major loss of love and vigor for a life has dwindled. This is the worst drug ever; please find an alternative for your symptoms! DO NOT TAKE CYMBALTA-it has the potential to ruin the very essence of who you are. It's not worth it; trust me!

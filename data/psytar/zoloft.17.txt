HORRID. Within a few days of taking it, horrible anxiety. I would look in the mirror and think "what is wrong with me!" I slept a lot, had no appetite whatsoever, lost weight, felt like I was not myself at all. I practically had a nervous breakdown on it. Yawning A LOT. I just felt so weird all the time, I HAD to come off it. It's been the worst anti depressant I ever took. (This was 10 years ago) and I have much better anti depressants since then. I was initially scared of ANY anti depressant after my experience with the Z. But about a year later I tried others and could tolerate them much better  (Such as Lexapro and Prozac.). I had a very bad reaction to this, though it does appear to help some, Don't be afraid to tell your doctor what it is doing to you and don't just go along with their "the side effects will go away." Not every med is for everyone. Tell them how you are feeling.

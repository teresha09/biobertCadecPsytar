I had hand shakes,warmness in my body,very energized,mood was alot better,sweating,pretty bad insomnia which i did not like. Loss in appetite but i think it is going to work hopefully. I just dont want to feel like I did before ever again! I just hope these side effects subside after taking it for awhile.

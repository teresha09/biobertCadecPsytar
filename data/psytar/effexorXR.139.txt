mild insomnia, poor interactions with alcohol. This is an excellent medication for anyone who has a depressiv or anxiety disorder. I suffer from both, and this is my second time on the drug. it has done a great deal for me. I have only been taking it for 6 months on my second bout, but I took it for two years before, and it did wonders. The only problems I had with it were when I came off it the first time. withdrawl is really tough, but past that, it's a good drug.

Initially some mild headaches and vision blurring. Now I get mild headaches, head buzzing or light headedness if I miss a dose. Some stomach discomfort occasionally for a few minutes right after taking it. Often can't stop yawning about 3:30 PM daily for about an hour. This really kicked me out of the doldrums quite quickly. I lost weight and felt great. After 7 months I do not feel any depression or anxiety but am not sure if I even need it anymore either. Have gained back all of the weight I lost and have a big appetite. I would recommend this medication - Wellbutrin didn't do a thing for me.

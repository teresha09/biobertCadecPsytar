don't know if my problems were because I wasn't depressed (I was misdiagnosed with depression when my problems were Claritin side effects). I had extreme anger and road rage. I literally screamed at a stranger over a parking spot. I also told off an attorney I was working with. These behaviors are not like me at all. There needs to be a class actiom.

night sweats, yawning, vivid dreams (but not bad ones); the first week felt dizzy; slightly reduced libido but more difficulty in reaching orgasm. Within a week I felt my energy level increase and depressed/suicidal thoughts decrease. After a month some of the anxiety and self-destructive urges returned, but I feel more able to manage these episodes and they are less crushing. Increased dose from 50 to 75 mg, maybe will increase to 100 mg. I still feel like "myself" but just less miserable and irritable. I feel tired a lot in the middle of the day but I always have in the winter anyway! Sex is still enjoyable but it's harder to climax, which is annoying, but I think is getting better with time. It has really helped for symptoms of depression and with less side affects than I was afraid of. I recommend it.

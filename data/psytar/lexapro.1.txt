extreme weight gain, short-term memory loss, hair loss. I am detoxing from Lexapro now. I slowly cut my dosage over several months and took vitamin supplements to help. I am now 10 days completely off and OMG is it rough. I have flu-like symptoms, dizziness, major mood swings, lots of anxiety, tiredness. I have no idea when this will end. I have been taking lots of vitamin supplements from truehope. com to help and it is still terrible. I just really want to be done with this. I would never have guessed withdrawal would be so terrible. I am looking to get pregnant and do not want to be on any medications. Also neurofeedback has been more helpful than the medicine ever was.

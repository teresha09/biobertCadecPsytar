had no negative side-effects and loved Seratraline. It has helped me a lot more than earlier meds. However, I have tried to taper and quit several times and CAN'T. I become dizzy, nauseus and can't function; feel as though I'm poisoned. One tiny dose makes all that badness go away in less than 30 minutes! So, yeah, I know I'm an addict. TODAY I'd like to know if my recent muscular twitches are related to this medicine. My belief is that once a person is on a med like this, his/her chemistry is changed, and, s/he can't "revert to the earlier version" of his/herself, so to speak. One is forever changed and cannot function as expected without the drug.

Really no negative side effects. Lost weight at first. After a month back to normal (very petite). No sexual issues or side effects of any kind. Life Changing Drug! Struggled with a horrible cycle of insomnia, anxiety, depression, life changes and hormonal changes for a year. On day one of taking Lexapro I fell asleep within an half hour for the first time in a year. Within a week I felt like my old self but even better, The worries, and the major (and i mean MAJOR deep dark hole depression) I experienced (especially PMS depression) is gone and has stayed gone. I can feel emotion but don't fall apart all the time and I CAN SLEEP up to 6 total hours a night. A huge improvement from 2 or 3 hours. I plan on embracing this drug as long as I need to

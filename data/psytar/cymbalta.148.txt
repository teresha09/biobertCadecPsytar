dry mouth(first couple days), tremors(spasms), sleeping more, loss of energy, sweating, lost interest in sex because had trouble climaxing. overall this medicine worked. noticed change in a day or two. i took 60mg for four maybe five months but have gone off cold turkey. been six days so far. only problem so far is vertigo. feels like my brain is riding a wave every once in a while

jaw-lock, muscle tightness, dehydration and dry mouth. After initial side effects of the 75mg dose wore off, moved to 150mg. experienced short term fx for a week each time I switched doses. long term side fx at 150 mg have been a lowered libido and some chronic muscle pain. Missing a single dose sends my brain into mini-seizures, or brain shivers, which produce migraine-like headaches. lasts until hours after I take the next dose. Have also had to supplement with Imipramine due to anxiety  (I've also noticed a weird increase in my blood sugar sensitivity, and find myself getting tired and much more irritable than usual if I skip a meal.). It saved my life - BUT - if you have never taken street drugs before. I would NOT recommend this drug. It's potency and side effects can be a nasty surprise for anyone who is taking it for mild depression. THIS IS A LAST RESORT DRUG. It should not be tried before other anti-depressants have been tried. It's been working wonders for me so far, after two other kinds failed. but I was debating suicide at the time. Sexual dysfunction is always better than death, though, so it's been no contest for me, DON'T QUIT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE SIDE EFFECTS. The drug doesn't even start working for the first three weeks, so grit your teeth, put up with the nausea or premature ejaculation or whatever and let it do it's job. If the side effects are worse than the depression, you're on the wrong drug. Easy as that, And DUH- withdrawal is gonna suck. The problem is, most doctors friends & family have NO idea HOW BAD withdrwal symptoms are. Meth was no problem to quit, Effexor, well, we'll see.

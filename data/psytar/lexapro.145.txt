grogginess, nausea, dry mouth, frequent urination. after 18 months, my body is well-adjusted to it and it helps a great deal with regulating my mood. I take 20 mg at night, and drink lots of water during the day to counteract side-effects. It increases the effect of alcohol and caffeine so I have to be careful with those. But overall am happy with it, much better than Zoloft.

Never experienced a panic attack until AFTER taking only 4 doses (25 mg.) of this medication. Had 2 panick attacks while on Zoloft, quit taking the drug and have not had any more attacks, but now I am dealing with the fear of when/where the next one will take place. I know a lot of people have had success with Zoloft, but it is not the right one for me. Be careful of the side effects that your doctor may not tell you about . that is  increased anxiety.

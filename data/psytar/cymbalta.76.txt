Hitting the wall with too many life problems resulted in the discontinuation of Effexor and immediately on to Cymbalta. At 60 mg 1x day for a month I felt fine. Doubling the I felt emotionally flat, no emotion. I had impulsivity, I think just to see if I could get some feeling. Constipation was awful with a large weight gain that put me out of all clothes save sweats. I had balance issues, and would get the shakes before my second dose. I did get permission to cut the dose to 60 mg 1x a day, but it has been pure hell going down as I have a whole set of new side effects. I am exhausted and sleep with vivid dreams such as I never had before, I am a step away from a migraine daily. I have sweats and then freeze. My heart races at rest and I am getting moody, even losing my patience with my dog. I have joint pain and can hardly move. Originally at 60 mg I felt great, and until 2 days ago, I didn't know I was on the highest dose. In hindsight, I would have never started it. I also had a sudden hearing loss experience and am now totally deaf in my left ear; it is sensioneural and will never return. I don't know if it is related but I lost my job because of it. I would like to know if anyone else experienced a hearing loss as my brother-in-law is a doctor in an unrelated field and he has never heard of such a thing. If you did, please contact me. Thanks.

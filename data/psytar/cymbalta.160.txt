SEVERE night sweats and increased sweating during the day, and somewhat difficult (but not impossible) to reach orgasm. I had intense headaches for the first 3 days of taking Cymbalta, but then the depression "fog" cleared and I felt much less weighed down by my thoughts. During the first few months of taking Cymbalta (30 mg) I used to wake up at least 2X during the night to change pajamas & sheets/bedding due to intense sweating & was losing lots of sleep. Now I don't wake up until morning but I am soaked with sweat. Overall, I have felt more like myself & much less depressed, but occassionally when I experience a setback, I don't dwell as much on my sad thoughts. Both my therapist & psychiatrist are extremely puzzled by the instense sweating, as though they're hearing of this side effect for the first time.

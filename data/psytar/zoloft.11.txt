Not sleeping for over 48 hours, heart palpitations, ending up in hospital in a manic state. Total sexual dysfunction which has continued for six months with no improvement after stopping the medication. Taking this drug was the worst decision I've ever made. Quite simply this medication has destroyed my life. Facing the possibility of a lifetime with no sexual enjoyment (and the impaired relationships this implies) has been devastating. Ironically I am much more anxious and depressed than before I took this drug.

In the beginning, I could not stop sleeping. While motivation rose, I found myself too tired to do anything. After a few weeks that ended as well as my crying spells, my hate for life, and my suicidal thoughts. If I was not currently on Zoloft, it may be easy to say that I would have ended my life by now. There were multiple occurances when I attempted to commit suicide. In other words, I was not in my right mind. After taking zoloft, I no longer had an urge to go out and get drunk all of the time. It really helped. I recommend this drug to anyone who needs help dealing with depression. I have tried being on Effexor for a while, however, that drug caused nausea and increased suicidal thoughts. Zoloft is the way to go.

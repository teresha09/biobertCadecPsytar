some dizziness, nausea, tiredness. Lexapro has been a great drug for me. I was on Paxil CR b4 and wanted to kill myself and everything in my path. Lexapro has steadied my emotions greatly. I don't cry about every little thing anymore. I don't have the night sweats or fits of rage anymore. It is a wonderful drug, although. i don't want to be on antidepressants the rest of my life. but this is the one i choose since i have to.

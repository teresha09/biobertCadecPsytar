INTENSE HOT FLASHES, PROFUSE SWEATING, particularly severe with stress and when too hungry - can get to the point of soaking, dripping sweat, soaked clothes, bed, chair, car seat, total embarrassment, happens worst at most inappropriate times. No one seems to understand why this happens, so embarrassing, even family mystified. It seems only a VERY TOXIC drug would have this side effect. Now, after 9 months, constant dull (sinus) headache, constant insomnia, caffeine intolerant (1 cup coffee = heart pounding, headache, agitation, uncomfortable for rest of day), 3 months ago weight started increasing, now 40 pounds heavier! Isolating, fuzzy headed, poorer concentration now 9 months after switching to Cymbalta, time to switch back or on to another SSNRI/SNRI or hopefully, maybe, something better! Effexor was on a similar uncomfort scale to Cymbalta for me, increased blood pressure, hot flashes/heat, sweating. Cymbalta, however, has decreased ability to orgasm much less than Effexor or Zoloft, Paxil caused much worse (totally intolerable) headaches. Cymbalta has helped with depression, but I've had better success with much less, unpleasant side effects from other medications, and soon I will be switching back. PLEASE - be careful with Cymbalta and all other SSNRIs/SSRIs, report all side effects, withdraw VERY SLOWLY - dizziness, "brain zaps", blackouts are inevitable result of withdrawing too quickly from all of this class, ONE MUST SHAVE PILLS DOWN BY CRUMBS IN DECREASING DOSE OVER LONG PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WITHDRAWING, A MG. AT A TIME - IF THIS IS NOT FOLLOWED CLOSELY, DANGEROUS AND UNPLEASANT WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME (SEROTONIN SYNDROME) RESULTS, AS SO MANY OF US HAVE REPORTED AND ARE FAMILIAR WITH! Please be careful, good luck, and good health.

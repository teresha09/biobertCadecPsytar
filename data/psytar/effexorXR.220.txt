For the 1st 2 weeks, I had pulsating headaches, and had nausea. After 2 weeks, the side effects went away, and the medication is fantastic. It gives me really vivid dreams, where I sometimes wake up, and have to remind myself what is reality, and what is just a dream. I've had a completely positive experience on this drug. I've lost weight, and feel all my emotions, but don't get into negative spirals anymore. I read the symptoms of depression now, and can't believe that I felt like that 5 months ago.

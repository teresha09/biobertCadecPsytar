lethargic, unusual dreams, yawning, difficulty reaching orgasm. I was diagnosed with "double depression".Started on 37.5 mg for about 2 weeks, no change, only very sleepy, missed worked, switched to taking at night, uppped to 75mg for a week or two, helped a little bit, I was at an extremely depressed point in my life before I started and it got me back to my "regular" state of derpression. I am now on 150mg, with hope that is will just get better. my ONLY side effects have been listed, but mainly unusual vivid dreams. My cocern is that I read more negative reviews of effexor than positive and it is really scary - ANYONE HAVE A GOOD EXPERIENCE ON THIS?

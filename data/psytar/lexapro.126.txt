Hair loss!, rashes, sexual loss. I was very suicidal when put on Lexapro and it helped me relax a great deal, I was so much more happy on it but had to stop taking it due to it causing hair loss and it killed my sex drive and feeling. I did act like a jerk on it as well a few times. Although if it wasn't for the hair loss and sexual side effects I would of stayed on it. Hopefully I will have better luck with something else. A very good drug to try

Insomnia for the first few days. Shakiness and numbness in fingers which went away after the first few days. Night sweats which I still get occasionally as well as very vivid dreams. I started on on a low dose and gradually increased to 150 mg. I feel so much better taking this drug and even my friends and family have noticed a dramatic change in my overall well-being, My Dr. started me on fluoxetine (Prozac- 10 mg) which I take in addition to the Effexor. Maybe for me it is the combination of the two but I have not experienced any of the negative side effects others have described. The ones I did experience certainly wouldn't make me stop taking it. Everyone is so unique and I'm sure this drug effects us all differently but for me it works extremely well and I plan to continue on it.

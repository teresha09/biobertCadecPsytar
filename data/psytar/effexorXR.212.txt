major nausea and vomiting the first week and a half for me, extreme dizziness. had to stay off work for a week or so. could definitely not drive in this state! have noticed a bit of sexual delay. hopefully it will not last. i feel calm and well balanced. i also feel productive and motivated to do things and participate in life! yipee. better for me than paxill. paxil had more sexual side effects.

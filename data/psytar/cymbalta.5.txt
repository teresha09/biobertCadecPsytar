blurred vision, sweating, shaking, nausea, vomiting, brief paralysis, tingling in extremities, fainting, heart palpitations, insomnia, severe abdominal pain, auditory/visual hallucinations, dizziness. I was prescribed Cymbalta as a possible alternative to Klonopin, which I have taken for over ten years. I took my first and ONLY dose of Cymbalta (60 mg) at 8:00 AM yesterday after breakfast. Almost immediately I started to sweat, began to feel very ill, and proceeded to throw up all morning and into the early afternoon. I could barely move or get out of bed. At one point I was certain that I was having heart failure, because my entire body seized up and I could not move or speak. It took me a day and a half to finally sleep, and I couldn't eat or drink anything until around 9:00 this evening (juice and some crackers). I still feel dizzy and nauseated, and my hands and feet are tingling. The only reason I'm sitting up at all is so I can warn others NOT to use Cymbalta. This stuff is like rat poison! AVOID IT AT ANY COST!

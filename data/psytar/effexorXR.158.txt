Extreme dry mouth, unable to reach orgasm. However, my sex drive is still Ok. No notable weight gain, as I have pushed myself to work out still. Felt a bit sluggish, but after a month or so on the 150mg dose, have overcome that side effect. The one and ONLY complaint is this horrible taste in my mouth- tastes metallic, and bitter, a secretion under my toungue. I hope it goes away- I'm brushing my teeth about 5 times a day! Lol. Keep a VERY close eye on your side effects with this drug. For a week, I had horrible suicidal thoughts and mood swings, which eventually went away. Have a support system- family, friends- to help you when you are down. It gets better. If you have high blood pressure, do NOT quit cold turkey, as this is a very BAD way to do with any of these types of drugs. contact your Dr, and if that doesn't help, get another opinion. There's help out there, and millions of people like us who know what we're all going through. :)

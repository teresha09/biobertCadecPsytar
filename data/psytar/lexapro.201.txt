First few weeks: fatigue, dry mouth, jaw clenching, night sweats, always feeling too warm, vivid dreams, What's still with me today? : extreme fatigue, night sweats, always too warm, slight jaw clenching, vivid dreams. Weight loss of about 10 lbs and I'm not complaining about that. I can deal with all these side effects, but would love to get rid of the fatigue. Even if I get 10 hours sleep. I always seem to want more. Sometimes I think the vivid dreaming keeps you from getting quality sleep, However, this medicine has been great-I had anxiety from divorce, new home, new job and dealing with a severely depressed ex-spouse (who is now on Effexor). The Lexapro has helped me to keep from dwelling on things I can't change. By the way, my counselor says that anxiety can be an inherited trait (my grandmother is on Paxil and my mom NEEDS to be on something).

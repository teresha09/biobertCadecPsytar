Profuse sweating. hot flashes, drowsy all of the time, brain fog, inability to concentrate, loss of sex drive, weight gain, constipation, muscle cramps, eye floaters. just to name a few. When I came off Cymbalta I had the worst side effects I could've ever imagined. it's been a few weeks and still have horrible effects. extreme muscle fatigue and muscle cramping and elevated liver enyzmes (no pre-existing liver damage or alcohol use/abuse,) just to name a few. My md is now completing more test and questioning if I have fibromyalgia or MS due to the test results and symptoms. These seemed to have been initiated after stopping the drug but symtoms did not exist prior to taking them. anyone else having these effects, if so, what was your outcome or did the symptoms go away? I can barely walk up a couple of stairs without a deep burning and fatigue within my muscles. Just curious of how dangerous this drug is and if I'm the only one with these problems.

Early on, naseau and sleeplessness. After a year and now on 225 mg I am sweating like crazy all the time, I get tingles in my hands and if I miss a dose I get dizzy and foggy and brain shivers. I am not able to leave the house until the meds kick in because I am physically just very sick. I have developed an ulcer given the medication is very hard on your stomach and recently had my eyes checked and now I have developed glaucoma (another lovely side effect of this drug) Never did get my sex drive back. Gained 40 pounds. This drug has changed my life but it has now become so problematic given all the negative side effects that I am not so sure it has changed my life for all the better. From what I understand getting off this drug is horrible. I am very worried about this.

Dizzy, light headed, foggy brain, just stoned! Exausted too! This is the 5th day of my trial with Cymbalta. Dizzy, light headed, foggy brain, just stoned! Dizzy, light headed, foggy brain, just stoned! Exausted too! I cant go on like this another day. Yes, it did take the anxiety away, but it's making mashed potatoes out of my brain. I cant take it. I am not going to take anymore. I'm stopping slowly today. I will have to try something else. I'm 54 years old and I have responsibilities. I cant stay home being stoned and exausted over this medicine.

Little nauseaus first couple of days. I already had all the gastro symptoms and hot flashes others have mentioned. Unfortunately, those symptoms have not improved. I am experiencing hair loss and am wondering what the cause may be-could be Cymbalta, could be my age/hormones, a vitamin I might need, winter. 30 mg worked initially then abruptly seemed to stop working after about 6 weeks/now on 60 mg I am happy to say I have not felt this good for years and years. Fibro pain greatly reduced, energy up, sleep and dreaming wonderful after many years of not much of either. I am very enthused and interested in my life again. Coming off Cymbalta does sound scary, but I am trying to just enjoy feeling well for now, will cross that bridge down the road. I am trying some different approaches to the thinning hair and hope I can solve it.

didn't have any side effects while taking the drug. I took 150 mg per day. I was never clinically diagnosed with depression or anything. I was going through a divorce and asked my doctor for something. I can't believe how readily they just hand you whatever is in the cabinet. Anyway, my life is on track, I have nothing to be depressed or sad about. I also have no health insurance at the moment, and it's pretty expensive, so I decided to quit taking it. COLD TURKEY. I knew there would be side effects, and I was ready for them. And boy did they arrive with a vengence! I've been off for a little over a week, and it's getting a little better. The first 3 days or so, I thought I was in the twilight zone. Dizziness, ringing of the ears, irritable, anxious, horrible nightmares, feelings of electrical surges in my body. My God, I wasn't in this bad of shape before I started taking the drug! Well, like I said, it's getting a little better everyday. But I feel I can say that this drug is VERY ADDICTIVE. Some people probably do need to be on it forever, but many do not. Everyone needs to know the side effects of coming off of this drug when it is given to them! I would've asked for something else! I wish I could've afforded to come off gradually, but oh well, what's done is done.

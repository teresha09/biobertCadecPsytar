Took first dose late yesterday morning after a late breakfast. It knocked me out within 30 min. & I slept 2 hours. After waking up, I had severe nausea & a bad headache,  Off & on that evening I was "spacey" and moved very slow, but I knew what was going on,  This morning, I did not hear my alarm go off for work, woke up 1 1/2 later, called boss, told her what was going on & was only late 30 min. I am typing this slowly & I barely know what's going on. My boss is checking on me. This is one strange, bad drug. Needless to day, I won't take another one & I hope it wears off soon, o

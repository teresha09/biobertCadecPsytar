Tired, dry mouth, dizziness on occassion. For treating major depression. Started with 25mg for first 2 weeks, started with 50 mg for next 2 weeks. Not really doing better yet. Heard that 100 mg is the typical dose for treatment, but have to gradually increase dose to lessen side effects. Haven't started therapy yet. Maybe it will help.

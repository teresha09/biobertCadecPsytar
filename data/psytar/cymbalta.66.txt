med helped for a while, but I gained about 30lbs in the midsection. I was always thin and fit before. was taking it for multiple failed fertility treatment's and devastating experience with failed IVF. became pregnant surprisingly (by natural means). my md stopped the 60mg cymbalta cold turkey and switched me to lexapro. I had to be hospitalized within a day for severe vomiting, & electrolyte imbalances. I felt terribly anxious and had heart palpitations I didn't understand. I had waited 7 years for a baby. At 12 1/2 weeks pregnant. after all that suffering, the baby died. DO Not stop this medication cold turkey. They make a 20mg capsule. then you can open it and remove some beads. my life will never be the same again.

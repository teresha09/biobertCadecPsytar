Tiredness a few hours after taking, "the munchies" -> some weight gain, dulled emotions (though this improved with time), slight sexual side effects. Gave me my life back after completely breaking down six months ago. Helped not only with the issues I was immediately experiencing (extreme panic and hypochondria) but long-standing social anxiety and obsessive thoughts have also been relieved. Still have mild depression. Side effects are annoying but a small price to pay for my life back.

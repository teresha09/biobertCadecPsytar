incredible drowsiness . napping many times a day for extended periods, night sweating. Lexapro has been great as far as balancing out my mood, and making me feel much less anxious and happy overall, However, the drowsiness is becoming a pretty big problem, especially when I am sleeping an average of 12 hours a day (mostly in 4-5 hour naps). Night sweating happens about twice a week, and is a pretty small side effect.

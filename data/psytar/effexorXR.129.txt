Delayed orgasm. Over the past five years, I've tried Prozac, Celexa, and Lexapro, all with no noticeable improvement. Actually, the first one I was ever on was Effexor, but only at 75mg A few months ago, I started taking Effexor XR, this time a 300mg, and I can finally notice a significant improvement.

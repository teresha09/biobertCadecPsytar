weight gain, muscle weakness/soreness, anxiety. I began the medication to help with my healing process. I am a cancer survivor. During the time, my children had both left for new careers and college, hence "empty nest syndrome". Three years later, I wanted wean off the drug with the help of my neurologist. To define best per my daughter, it's like getting off crack coccaine! I screamed at her when the microwave oven blasted the scrambled egg! I don't do that. I would normally laugh. The same day, moments later, I had an anxiety attack. I literally was out of control. My daughter did not leave for work until my husband had returned home. She did not want to leave me alone for fear of me causing myself harm. I felt suicidal. I was shaking, I had tremors, my mind was confused, I had no logic to my scientific mind. This medication does more harm then good. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!

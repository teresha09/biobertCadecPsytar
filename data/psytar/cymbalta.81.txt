fatigue,irritability,lack of appetite(without weight loss). Started at 30mg and increased to 60mg Very bad fatigue Week#1 then a little less during Week#2, especially in afternoons. No impressive mood benefits, just drawbacks: the most notable was irritability everyday with a general negative outlook and being easily angered. Need a different drug.

Stomach is in knots, tension in the front part of my head, shakiness, blurred vision. I took 10mg for the first time last night before bed and I could barely sleep. I don't even know if I did sleep! My back hurt so bad in the middle of the night I had to take an Ibuprofen, Now I'm at work and I'm shaking so bad and my stomach is so tight! I hope this goes away. I can't seem to focus, my eyes are blurred and sensitive to the light.

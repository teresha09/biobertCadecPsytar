NO sex drive, severe fatigue, sweating, mild jaw clenching. I've been on Effexor for about three years now, and I have to say that along with therapy, it really saved my life. However, the side effects are awful, but to me it's worth it because after trying Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Zoloft, this is the only thing that makes me feel better. I have to take Adderall XR in combination with the Effexor just to keep me awake during the day because if i don't, i absolutely can't function; I will literally just sleep all the time, to the point where it truly can disrupt my life at times. I had never experienced a fatigue like that before, and it can be very dibilitating. I have absolutely NO sex drive, but that didn't happen until about a year ago. I wake up a lot in the morning with my jaw feeling tired and aching, and it never even occured to me that it may have been because of the Effexor (until i came upon this site!). The sweating is really bad, but i've found a great solution - aerosol deoderant! I've tried going off of Effexor before. it's hell,

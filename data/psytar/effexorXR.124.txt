Yawning at first, no appetite, fatigue, no sex drive. Now that I've been on it for a while, I get random tics when at rest that aren't severe enough to really bother me. My knees shake a bit and my dexterity seem a little impacted going down stairs, but it's worth feeling normal again. I had pretty mild side effects at first, nothing severe enough to make me want to quit taking it and nothing out of the ordinary. I used to panic while driving, worried about what other drivers thought of me, I couldn't function at work or with my coworkers, I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. I'm back to feeling totally normal and it's wonderful. Totally worth any of the minor side effects I feel now. My appetite is back and the sexual side effects and fatigue are gone.

don't experience side affects while on Cymbalta but when I am off. If I forget even a single day of this medicine I feel completely gone the next. Dizzy, lightheaded, tired. It makes me think it works i guess but I hate the withdrawals. I forgot to call in my prescription once and had to skip for a whole weekend (this was the first time). I was DEAD for the next week. I wanted to do nothing but sleep and sleep and sleep. It helps depression but beware of the horrible withdrawals.

weight gain, extreme spaciness and forgetfulness, loss of vocabulary, lethargic, cloudy head, lack of concentration. The first few months i was on Zoloft my depression and anxiety were definitely lifted. But in the past month, things have a taken a turn. I'm tired all the time, have gained 10 pounds and can't think straight. This drug has made me feel really stupid and I find myself at aloss for words quite often - simply because I can't think of the right words to use. But my overall mood has been much better which I guess is a good thing. But do i want to be dumb and happy or smart and depressed? Hmmm. I saw my doctor today and am going to switch drugs. I'm a little nervous about the withdrawl from Zoloft after hearing other reports here. I'll be sure to write back with my experience.

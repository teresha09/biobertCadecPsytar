The first 2 months it seemed to be fine, then the terrible night sweats came,the headaches,dizziness, out of sorts feeling came. Since last November my tendons on both arms started hurting by the elbow, then came extreme fatigue, and heaviness And pain in the calves of my legs came. Not to mention the acid reflux, having bowel movements 5 times in the morning,abdominal cramping, couldent eat, no appetite. Had stomach checked with upper GI and colonoscopy. Now I have an erosive esophagus. My doctor at the time sent me to 2 ENT doctors a Rhuemotogist, went to ER in Dec and Jan. Forgot to mention stuffed up nose and constant cough. Changed my primary care Dr, had tests on my heart, ultra sound in legs, so now I have fast heart rate,poor circulation. Had 5 friends pass away from December 2014 to May of 2015 started getting depressed. I went to a shrink and they increased the dose to 90 mg. Took it for 2 months and felt worse than ever. Started weaning off cymbalta with shrinks help and he added 50 mg zoloft as I weaned off. As of last Sunday I don't take the cymbalta any longer. But I still have bad pain in my right arm, legs and feet, the pain is heaviness and electic shocks. The sweating stopped, I still have diarreha, and nausea and pain all over my body. I do have scolosis in my T spine. Hips hurt joints in feet snap crackle and pop, from time to time dizziness and headache. It's been 1 week since I quit taking this poison. I'm afraid that my legs will never be the same. I.

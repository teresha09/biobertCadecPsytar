Possible loss of libido. This medication has done absolutely NOTHING for me. I am so glad to be off of it. I started at 5 mg, went up to 10 mg, 15, 20, 30, and even to 40 mg! At that dosage I was so tired and irritable. I do not see the point of taking Lexapro-type SSRI's for anxiety, which was my primary issue for taking it. I do not think Lexapro gave me any seriously adverse side effects. it just didn't help with the anxious and depressive symptoms. it may as well have been a sugar pill.

Headaches, nauseau, dizziness, always on a bad high, inability to concentrate. Bad diarrhea and abdominal pains. The desire to just sleep my life away, but not suicidal. Anxiety got worse. I do experience some of these symptoms naturally, but it all got worse. Constant bad headaches and nauseau. My sex drive did not get any less. But I do have the inability to eat or care about food. Too nauseaus to eat anything but a few crackers or some bread. The nausea is pretty bad normally, so I may try something else. This one was my first SSRI. I had more anxiety attacks, acting out on loved ones. I'm calling the doctor first thing tomorrow morning.

Extremely tired, low motivation and energy. NO LIBIDO, anxiety, s/s of OCD ie biting nails and lips, lightheadedness/dizzy, occasional nausea. I was on wellbutrin and prozac combo, but I had decided to take myself off as I was getting alot of severe headaches. I was not sure if meds were contributing to this. However, the depression and moodiness quickly returned and my psychiatrist decided to try Cymbalta. Started out on 30 which did nothing. Eventually increasing dose to 90)  I have actually felt more tired during day and difficulty with sleeping. I have a tendency toward seasonal affect disorder and cymbalta has not done anything to improve this. In fact, I feel worse this year as compared to last year when I was on Welbutrin and Prozac. Further, I suffer from PMS and Prozac was highly effective for relieving those symptoms. I am now back on Wellbutrin to start and will see how it goes.

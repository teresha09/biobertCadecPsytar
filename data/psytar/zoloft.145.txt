No noticeable side effects until dosage was increased from 50 to 100mgs, then I noticed decrease in sex drive and increase in weight gain. I love Zoloft because of the very few side effects and its effectiveness in treating my anxiety and depression. I haven't needed to take a Xanax in a long time. Unfortunately, the weight gain and sex drive issue is driving me crazy, and I am considering switching to another drug because of this, but it appears that the other SSRIs have the same issues. I do highly recommend this drug, but everyone is different. My mom tried taking it and she broke out in hives, or hive-like bumps all over her body.

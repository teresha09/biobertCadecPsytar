ZOLOFT-ABSOLUTELY NONE I am writing this post as a cautionary note to anyone about to switch to generic. I have been taking zoloft for the past 12 years no side effects changed my life! Insurance switched to generic and I am struggling with headaches vivid dreams in which I awake in panic attacks full of sweat and have only been on the generic about a week. My doctor said this was not uncommon and promptly wrote a dispense as written note to my pharmacist,insurance companies must cover if dr writes this. Stay with the actual ZOLOFT these generics are not the same in absorbtion and can cause major setbacks

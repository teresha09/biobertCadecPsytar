loss of appetite. I started at 37.5mg the first week then went up to 75mg and immediatly started to feel better. I feel better but I still havnt noticed any change in my energy or anxiety but the doctor said it could take a few weeks before I would get the full effects but Im really happy with the results so far. Ive taken several anti depressants and this is the only one that has done anything for me, I just hope it doesnt wear off.

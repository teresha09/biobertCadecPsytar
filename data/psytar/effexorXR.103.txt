Inability to orgasm on dosages higher than 75mg a day. Slight apathy and abscent-mindedness (I make lots of typos, etc). I guess that's because it's an effective anti-anxiety drug for me. Apart from that, no adverse side-effects. Before Effexor XR, I tried: paxil, citalopram, sertraline and trazadone. None of them helped much. Some made me feel worse. Effexor is the first antidepressant that has really helped. And I noticed positive effects from day one. My anxiety is much improved. I sleep better. I get fewer tension headaches. My energy levels are back to normal. I still sometimes feel unmotivated on waking up in the morning, but I don't want to increase the dose above 75mg because of the anorgasmia, and the potential difficulties in eventually quitting the drug. I did try 150mg a day for a week, but the benefits didn't increase. The main benefits for me are the reduction of anxiety and the improvement in my energy levels. I used to take Ativan for anxiety, but that made me absent-minded. Effexor doesn't make me so absent-minded. It hasn't really lifted my mood much, but my mood wasnt really my problem. My problem was severe debility, brought on, I think, by long-term anxiety.

Long-term use of SSRIs (not just this one) caused Serotonin Syndrome, which included incontinence. Stopped once I went off them, restarted when I restarted them, so it was definitely them causing it. I'm fine now that I'm off them, but these drugs shouldn't be on the market in my opinion. Avoid if possible, or only take for a very short time if you do take them.

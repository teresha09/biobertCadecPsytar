Over a 10 yr period I have gained 70 lbs Other than that, it helped me with my anxiety attacks and depression. I also went to a pychiatrist and he helped me change the way i process my thoughts. I used to have one negative thought that would snowball into two etc So with behavioral therapy and 100 mg a day of Zoloft, I was able to feel at ease. Keep record of your weight when starting. My doctor and I just realized that my weight gain might be from the Zoloft. With the approval and supervision of my doctor I am trying to get off of the medication. I have gone down to 50 mg a day, and had no withdrawls. I have tried to quit cold turkey and have experienced what some call "brain shivers". It usually happens with another antidepressant. A simple Google search will bring up what myself and other people experience. This was only when I was getting OFF of the Zoloft too quickly.

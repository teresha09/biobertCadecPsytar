insomnia, low libido, drowsiness, dry mouth. This drug changed my life completely. I didn't even know what Social Anxiety Disorder was until a few months ago, only to find out that I had a pretty serious case of it beginning as a teenager. All these years I had just assumed that by nature I was anti-social and extremely shy, only to find out that millions of people suffer from SAD. I'm one of those believers who thinks that everyone should take Zoloft. It's not only controlling my anxiety and depression but it's controlling anger, and my thought process in general. Before Zoloft I was easily confused, now I can think clearly and control my thoughts.

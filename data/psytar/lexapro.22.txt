Weight gain, HAIR LOSS, increased depression, fatigue, lethargy. I switched from Cymbalta to Lexapro and after approximately 30 days, I began feeling very bad. I gained 13 lbs in 6 weeks and could not get out of bed after 60 days. My hair started falling out by the handful. I quit cold turkey last week and I feel a lot better today but hair loss continues. Doc said that should reverse within a month. Very negative experience.

No appetite I went 3 days without eating and didn't realise until my partner was ramming a sandwich down me, now just a smaller appetite and still forget to eat. Blurred vision, diarrhoea, nausea, heart burn, hyper/wired can stay awake for 48hrs so have to take a sedative to sleep, insomnia, brain zaps/waves like vertigo but whilst sitting, speech problems and speech block, memory loss, suicidal thoughts with one attempt, dry mouth, involuntary movements like jerking. Reading through this yes the side effects have been awful and pretty persistent but I'll now explain below. Basically I anise these tablets no end and take up to 800-1000mg hence all the side effects, but because I abused them so heavily at the start a normal dose now gives me withdrawal which gives all the above side effects. So they work just don't abuse them or get blinding drunk as trying to kill yourself happens.

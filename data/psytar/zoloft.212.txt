nausea, light headedness, dry mouth, bad taste in mouth. Anxiety in beginning just from the thought of taking med because I was already anxious. Had to conquer fear of meds first. Then it helped me a huge amount over the last 2 years. Please stick with it and keep taking the med for about 3-6 months. I never thought I could live a normal life again but I am.

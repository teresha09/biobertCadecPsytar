I have only taken cymbalta twice and am going to stop now before my symptoms get worse. I feel a lot worse than I did before taking it. I constantly feel as if I am on the verge of a panic attack, I feel like sleeping all day, but have difficulty sleeping for more than 1 hour at a time even during the night. I have aches and pains as if I have the flu.

increased migraine and headaches frequency (went from very rarely to frequently), vomitting, nausea, initially constipated then just diarrhea, disturbing twitching while trying to fall asleep, not the usual twitching, very dry mouth, loss of libido ( got better when I decreased from 150mg to 100 mg after 3 months), also have occasional yawnitis as I call it which was worse in the beginning, also had terrible motion sickness I have never had before from flying, alot of dizziness if I forget my dose after just an hour since I decreased to 100mg a month ago, irritability, fall asleep at work sometimes lasting all day, somewhat better after taking the medicine at noontime, waking up in the middle of the night is completely resolved since taking the meds at noontime rather than before bed, definitely I am not losing weight, had panic attacks and that weird tingly feeling for first 2 weeks but these went away. the irritablility is less than the irritability I had from PMS before taking zoloft. despite the side effects the medicine works very well for anxiety. I still have trouble waking up in the morning which I thought was depression but maybe I just have a sleep disorder. I am going to switch back to celexa if possible since I took that before and the side effects were minimal and also to try and avoid zoloft withdrawl . from there on I don't know what I will do b/c celexa seemed to stop working after a year which was why I switched to zoloft. my doctor wanted to just increase my dose of celexa but this made me very dizzy, almost blind when I would stand up fast or get out of bed. looking back this seems not half as bad as the side effects from zoloft.

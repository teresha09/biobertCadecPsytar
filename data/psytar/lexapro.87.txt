poor short-term memory, increased alcohol craving, increased reaction to alcohol/blackouts, vivid dreams, sleep disturbances (talking in sleep), weight gain (15+ lbs) and decreased sex drive. Not sure if Lexapro really helped with my depression and anxiety, fortunately have a good therapist and positive environmental changes. Side effects were apparent almost immediately (except weight gain which happened gradually, but drastically accumulated-never been this heavy before in my life). Added Wellbutrin to try to counter-act Lexapro side effects, but not doing the trick. Going off Lexapro SLOWLY at the moment, withdrawal symptoms( from missing a dose) very strong-brain zaps, dizziness, weakness and fatigue.

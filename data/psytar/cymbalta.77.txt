After 3 days my tongue was triple in size and a dark maroon color vivid dreams weird and wild,sores on tongue,no crying,head aches were gone. I liked that it made me seem emotionally detached events happened that would normally make me burst into tears but with Cymbalta I was emotionally free. I had less headaches I hate that I had a reaction to it and my doctor took me off of it.

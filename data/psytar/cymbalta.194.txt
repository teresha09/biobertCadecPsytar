The first few days were like a fog. I didn't eat much due to nausea and then it was fine. Had a headache too. Difficulty with reaching orgasm. I stopped taking it cold turkey ( I actually just forgot to use it for 5 days) and suffered 0 side effects or reactions. Originally I was put on it with a view to ceasing after 6 months but I was terrified I'd revisit the horrible depression and anxiety so I stayed on it.

First day nausea. but started taking with a ginger capsule, now no problem with nausea. I feel happier, less "blue" I do have problems sleeping thru the night (I'm writing this at 4:30 am) but am hoping with continued dosage, that will subside. I have noticed decreased appetite and leg twitching (can't sit still). Hopefully these side effects will subside after a couple more days/weeks. One other thing is dry mouth. none of these side effects bad enough to discontinue drug so far.

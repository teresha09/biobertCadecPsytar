WORST WITHDRAWAL EVER. I've been on anti-depressants for at least 5years, and I've tried multiple ones but by far effexor was the worst. Yea it helped during the time I took it. But if I missed a dose I got those "brain zaps", and I just felt in a fog not myself at all. But when I came off it was the WORST experience I felt like I was in withdrawal from a hardcore drug. Brain zaps constantly, the shakes, sweating, nightmares, anxiety, muscle spasms, and crying spells, Don't take effexor its not worth the risk of a horrible withdrawal. It has a half life of 5hours, that's why you feel so crummy after missing one dose. awful awful medication.

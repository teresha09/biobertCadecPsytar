I was on a very low dose, so I'm not sure if the fatigue and brain fog was due to the drug or the depression that proceeded it,  HOWEVER, I had experienced TERRIBLE withdrawal when coming off the drug. (These information are findings, just this ) I was having painful, debilitating brain zaps, several per second, and though they gradually lessened, they lasted for months after I quit taking the drug. This drug really didn't help either of my problems at all.

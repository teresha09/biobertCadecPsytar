Constapation, vivid dreams. It has helped my depression, but I hate the weight gain, and I have a constant feeling/need to eat. The withdrawl symptoms are horrible if you miss a dose. Vertigo, nausea, muscle aches, flu-like symptoms, diarreha. I won't off this medicine due to the horrible side effects, withdrawl symptoms and weight gain. But it is miserable. Its great for depression and anxiety, but I would not recommed it due to the horrible side effects and withdrawl symptoms.

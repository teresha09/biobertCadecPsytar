Weight gain ( 20 pounds in 6 months )adverse sexual side effect, loopy when trying to come off of it, threw up many times a week within an hour of taking med. not good due to weight gain, when coming off of it you feel OUT OF IT- sometimes I am even scared to drive a car because I feel so off. I am now on Wellbutrin ( awesome ) but I am still on effexor and have decreased my dose which makes you feel outside of yourself. I did not take any of the effexor yesterday as I hope to just take Wellbutrin but I am even having trouble typing these comments because I did not have a dose of effexor in the past 24 hours. Not a good suggestion for depression.

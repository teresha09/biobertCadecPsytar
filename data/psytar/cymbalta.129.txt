extreme dry mouth, to the point where I constantly felt as if something was stuck in my throat which would in turn cause me to have an anxiety/panic attack, decreased appetite, severe insomnia. Cybalta definitely helped with my depression but the side effects really took a toll on me after only a week. I had barely slept and had lost over 6 pounds within the first week because just the thought of food would make me sick to my stomach. I was constantly drinking water and had to have a bottle by my side at all times, it was just incredibly uncomfortable.

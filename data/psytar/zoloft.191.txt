insomnia, low sex drive, trouble reaching orgasm, euphoria (not bad at all), agitation, drowsiness. This is a great drug for depression and social anxiety. I feel normal around people for the first time in my life. Before, people always made me nervous, anxious or just uncomfortable in some way. The nice thing about Zoloft is that it feels natural and it doesn't seem like I'm "on" a drug. I feel normal, though I know the drug is working. Considering how my life was before taking Zoloft, the side-effects are well worth it!

I HATED THIS PRODUCT. i took the 10 mg once and a right now a week and a half later. i have noticed increases in my headaches, the front of my brain burns and i've noticed an increase in suicidal thoughts and anxiety. I would not recommend taking this at all. i wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. God help me, DON'T TAKE IT.

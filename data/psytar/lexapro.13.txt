Jaw jacking/clenching teeth, headaches, vomitting, waking up in the middle of the night for hours, increase in anxiety, blurred vision. I started feeling the side effects the fist day i took 10mg. Crazy dreams and visions, slight insomnia, my teeth are killing me from grinding them and I guess that caused my headaches. Can hardly even read and feel like I'm in a fog or that I'm stoned. Clumsy and at first gave me tons of energy but I think that was the increased anxiety. About four hours after my dose it's like I went downhill, my head got very heavy, and that was the foggy state. I haven't noticed any positive changes and the side effects are horrible. The increase in anxiety has made me stop taking this pill. Xanax or something would do me much better with the Effexor that I am already taking.

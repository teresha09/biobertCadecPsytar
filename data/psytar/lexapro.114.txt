yawning, fatigue, loss of libido/ability to ejaculate, loss of emotional range. I started with 10mg for a few weeks. This dosage made me very sleepy about 5 hours after taking it. I would yawn constantly and uncontrollably. I cut back to 5mg and started taking the medication in the evening. This helped tremendously. The sleepiness disappeared, However, I have problems ejaculating. And while I am now very slow to anger, I am slow very slow to excite. My emotions feel muted, and my former compulsiveness is replaced with listlessness. I am not depressed, but I feel that life is without excitement.

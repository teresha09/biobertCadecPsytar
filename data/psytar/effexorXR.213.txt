In the beginning, and with each dose increase. I experienced a bit of nausea and mild dizziness. Constipation was a problem for a few weeks as well. That was about three years ago and I am just starting back up on this drug again after a relapse of depression. This time I am having the dizziness again as well as a mild headache so far; nothing I can't handle. When I reflect on my first experience with this drug, I realize that for once. I was feeling normal. I was much easier to get along with, didn't blow things out of proportion and had a much more positive attitude about life. I also got my appetite back and managed to put on the weight I had lost as a result of my anxiety, Overall. I got my motivation back to enjoy life. After a relapse of depression over the last year. I am hopeful that I will feel "normal" again over the next few weeks. I am keeping my fingers crossed that it will work for me as well this time around as it did the first time. This drug is certainly not for everyone, but realize that you don't have to go through life feeling "blah" all the time. It may be depression and medication can help, whether it is Effexor XR or another drug. It certainly helped me and I'm optimistic about it helping me again.

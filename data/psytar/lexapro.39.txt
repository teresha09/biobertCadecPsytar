GAINED ONE POUND A WEEK for six months, Yep, 30 POUNDS. Been off of it for eight months, now bigger, have high BP and pre-diabetes because of the weight gain. I want to sue. Before I got any fatter, I stopped taking it and my metabolism is MESSED UP. I eat so much less than I used to, and still can't seem to lose the weight I gained while on Lexapro. I'd rather be normal sized and anxious than overweight, taking BP meds and insulin medication!

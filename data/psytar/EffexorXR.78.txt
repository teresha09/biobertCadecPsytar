Drowsy throughout the day, sleeping for a long time, weird dreams, heart palpitations, minor muscle spasms, lower libido, skipped periods often, heavy periods when I did get them, migraines, feeling slightly more aggressive, lowered mental capacity. It at least did something, but the amount of side effects speaks for itself. It helped anxiety slightly, but made my depression worse in my eyes. Despite the slight amount of energy I had. I felt even less motivation to direct it towards anything productive. My inability to think correctly lead me to get frustrated when I tried to get work done, and also lead me to being more rash with decision making. Sleeping more did not affect my sleep schedule. In other words; I was up for less hours at a time. Weird dreams is honestly the only good thing about this drug for me. The amount of side effects sure made life even less fun than it already was. Quitting this drug was horrible. Constantly felt like I was about to faint, felt like my brain was being zapped with an electrical discharge. These were strong feelings, even though I was gradually reducing the amount. I heard taking an SSRI while weaning off helped, since withdrawal from SSRIs is not nearly as bad, but I didn't have that since it was my decision to quit. This is surprisingly strong stuff. My brain chemistry still feels different, and I wonder if I'll ever fully recover from this. This was my second in line for antidepressants, and if your doctor recommends this so soon, reject it. Try something else before you risk taking this. Getting someone addicted to this so they have to keep buying it is dangerous. It does actually affect your behaviour though, so it may be worth trying if everything else won't work.

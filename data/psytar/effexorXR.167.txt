Frankly, I have been on Effexor XR so long that it is hard to tell what side effects I do have. I guess I can say that there are times my blood pressure increases. Other than that, I can't think of a side effect. I have been on so many of the SSRI's that is  Celexa, Prozac, Serzone, Lexapro, Wellbutrin XR, Remeron. None work like the SNRI, Effexor XR with me. I've been as high as 300 mg and as low as I am now at 112.5 mg I've been on Effexor XR for over 9 years. My doc will add a mood stabilizer when I need one. Other than that, I'm staying with Effexor XR.

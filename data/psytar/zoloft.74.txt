completely destroyed what was left of my sex drive (and almost my marriage). I only take it now when I am having a particularly BAD day (suicidal). Good part is it works immediately. Also helped me gain over 40 lbs that won't come off no matter what I do. Chronic constipation, too. Don't like that feeling of not caring about anything, though, good or bad.

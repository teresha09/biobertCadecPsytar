Lack of motivation. Slowing of cognitive thoughts, constipation(mild). Good drug in terms of lack of side effects, specially when compared to other antidepressants, After awhile, the drug just made me numb, I couldnt really feel anything, and there was a desire in me to look for stimulation elsewhere. I bought this root stimulating shampoo, and a follicle stimulator cause my head felt numb, wouldn't take showers cuz i would feel numb afterwards. If not for the numbness this would be a great drug.

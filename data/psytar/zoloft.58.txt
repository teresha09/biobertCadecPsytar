At first, terrible diarrhea. After a few days, insomnia and headaches. After a few weeks, extreme apathy and lack of initiative/drive/motivation. It did, however, fix the seratonin related imbalance, such as excessive crying and worrying. I would NOT recommend this med to anyone, especially those who have an active social life. This medication caused a horrible dopamine imbalance, which current medicine can, but WILL NOT TREAT. I have been treating myself with dopamine agonists and dopamine precursors, which are definetely working. If you suspect depression. it would be worth your while to do some research about neurotransmitters, etc I have found that medical trends fail to recognize how dangerous these medications can be; the medical community is saturated by mass loads of marketing by pharmecutical companies, which I think is sad because any seller WILL MOST LIKELY NOT state side effects, in an effort to sell the drug. It's very sad, but it proves to me that medicine is just a money making field, instead of a people helping field.

was initially on Effexor and slowly got up to 100 mg a day. Was on this for several years, had back surgery and wanted to quit Effexor because I was no longer depressed or in pain. Withdrawal was very, very difficult as many here state. I ended up staying on a maintenance dose of half of a 37.5 mg tablet. After a year or so on this I had more spinal problems and related nerve pain. Upped the Effexor to 75 mg without much pain relief. I now switched to XR 150 mg for the past six months. I have lots of neck problems (DDD, herniation, stenosis, etc) so I thought the severe pain in my hands and arms was the result of that. HOwever, in thinking about when the pain increased, I realized that it coincided with my switch to a higher dose and XR. To compound the problem, I was put on Diovan 160 mg for high blood pressure at the same time. So I don't really know if the increase in pain is related only to the Effexor XR or Diovan also. Overall, Effexor did very well relieving my depression. It helped keep migraines at bay and I had tolerable, minimal side effects. But getting off of this drug is really nasty. I had to d/c my meds a few days before a neck myelogram and had a very bad reaction to the lack of Effexor in my system. My pain increased tremendously and I was a basket case emotionally with crying, etc I had to go back on the Effexor and make an appointment with my prescriber to find something to cover me for when I have the myelogram. I had the "typical" brain zaps and odd brain feeling, dizziness, anxiety. I would love to d/c this drug forever once my neck problems have been taken care of.

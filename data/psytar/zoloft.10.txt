Severe chest pain, huge weight gain, onset of fibromyalgia and horrible arthritis pain. Drs thought I had Lupus. Have been off work for 8 months due to the effects of Zoloft. Within 45 days of starting Zoloft I gained 50+ lbs I started having sever chest pains. I had to have a heart cath, echo, stress echo and several other heart test. Was in ER 4 times and Was in CCU 2 times. Finally the third Cardiologist said it was the Zoloft and took me off. I was so sick I thought I would die. Stayed away from my grandkids cuz I didn't want them to find me dead. Lost all of my energy. developed Shortness of breath, fibromyalgia type pain, arthritis pain. Could barely walk. Broke my leg (had to have surgury) trying to walk up my porch steps. I have been off work for 8 months. I have suffered many side effects from the prednisone used to treat the symptoms. I am just now starting to feel better. Maybe I can return to work when I get the cast off of my leg. I lost my job and will have to find another one. This stuff is very scary. My sister went on it and started having chest pain and I told her to STOP immediatly.

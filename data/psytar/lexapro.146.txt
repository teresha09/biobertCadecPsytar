Loss of libido, Difficulty reaching orgasm, fatigue I feel tired most of the time, yawning, dry mouth,weight gain. I started taking 10 mg lexapro after I developed post natal depression. I have suffered depression anxiety and panic attacks in the past. I found it very helpful. It made me feel so much better and completely stopped the anxiety and panic attacks. The biggest complaint I have is the fatigue and loss of sex drive/orgasm and weight gain. I am now taking 20mg. I am now considering talking to my doctor about trying a different med.

Body tremors, Low sex drive, Difficulty getting an erection, Loss of need to socialize, and Weight gain. If it were not for Effexor XR (300 mgs) and Lamictal (75 mgs) I would not have been able to focus and stay on task in finishing my bachelor's degree. This drug may work too well in allowing me to see the world for what it really is almost in an alienating way. Effexor XR makes being alone perfectly fine and combined with the low sex drive I feel little need to meet people which is not good. I get withdrawls on the 2nd day of not taking the medication to the point of being frantic,not lovely. The food I used to avoid I LOVE now. to the point of gaining 40lbs which is also not lovely. Hope the comments help and good luck.

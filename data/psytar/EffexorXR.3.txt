Extreme irritability, weight gain and sleepless are just a few side effects of this horrible drug. Sure it helps depression because it makes you not give a rats ass about anything! I was on 225 mg and have weaned down to 37,5. The only way I can sum it up is to say I wish I could be put to sleep for a month or so while this gets out of my system. Horrible Horrible Horrible

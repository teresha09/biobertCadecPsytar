None yet! Haven't started. I have to say, after reading this site's and others about Cymbalta, I'm a bit freaked out in switching from Zoloft. BUT, I gotta say this. I would like to know what other medications those who have some of the horror stories here are on. I'm no doctor, but it seems like there are some combinations that would explain much of the issues above. Also, it seems as though this drug isn't a great treatment for anything other than depression/axiety. I know Lilly wants to get the old market penetration, but GEEZ. don't use a shovel when you need a screwdriver! If I have any of the issues I've read here, you bet I'll be back to let you know.

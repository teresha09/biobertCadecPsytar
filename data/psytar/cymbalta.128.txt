major constipation, weight gain, night sweats, excessive sweating (mostly face and head). I started on this and immediately noticed the constipation and sweating. My hair would be drenched by the time I got to work in the morning - even with the AC on in the car. Doc put me on something for that and it worked during the day but I wake up nightly with soaked clothes. I thought I could deal with it but after 4 months, I am feeling the exhaustion of not getting full nights' sleep. I like the overall way I feel - not too pumped up but not depressed, but the lack of sleep has led me to yet another failed medication.

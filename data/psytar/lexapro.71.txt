Initially, Lexapro seemed to agree with me except for the occasional bad nightmare, Now, after 4 years of use, I am no longer depressed, but I am exhausted all the time. I spend most of my spare time in bed sleeping . I'm barely participating in life. I seriously thought I had chronic fatigue syndrome, but after reading about other people's experiences, now I suspect it's the Lexapro. I am unable to drive on the freeway because of panic attacks while driving, Also, my body fat has been redistributed to my abdomen. Normally my waist is 10-12 inches smaller than my hips, but now it is about 5 inches smaller. Not a good look! My side effects from Lexapro are worse than my side effects from Zyprexa, and that's saying a lot. I've been taking one antidepressant or another since 1989)  Prozac was my favorite, but it stopped working after 10 years. I tried Effexor, but it created blood pressure issues. Because of that, I asked my psychiatrist to switch me to Lexapro. He seemed reluctant, but went along with it. I do feel Lexapro helped me recover from the severe episode. I started taking Lexapro in the 4th year of the episode, and recovered in the 5th year, Now it's 3 years post recovery, and I wish I hadn't stayed on it this long. Because of my history, I continued to take it as a sort of insurance poplicy against future episodes. Now I feel I am paying too high of a price in terms of my health and future, and I am going to discontinue taking it, very slowly.

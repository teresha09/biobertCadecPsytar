Initial-brain zaps, headache, fatigue: all went away after 2 weeks Later-Weight gain. This drug worked very well for anxiety and mild depression. If you can tough it out for the first couple of weeks with the side effects. it is worth it. Really quite amazing. I was actually able to overcome a long-standing fear of flying. I have gained weight that I have been unable to lose with diet/exercise. I have discontinued my daily 10 mg dose to see if I can lose the weight. I did not have any withdrawal side effects.

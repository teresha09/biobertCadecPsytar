feel wired, feel homicidal/suicidal, agitated, no appetite, confused. took my first dose this A. M. Will struggle through to see if benefits outweigh this horrible feeling. I am a recovering meth addict and feel exactly as if I am coming off of meth! Slamming beers( which I have not done for years) to counteract total feelings of rage and despair!

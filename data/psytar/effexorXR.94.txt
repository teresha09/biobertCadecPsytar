Initially sick all of the time. Now on it for three years and have gained 25 pounds. Decreased sex drive. Emotionally much better and able to function but getting depressed about the side effects. It has helped me to be a better parent but the side effects are getting to hard to handle. I am afraid of withdrawl.

Shaking, Irritable, Energy, later fatigue, constipation, anxiousness, anxiety attacks, craving sweets, flu like symptoms, ear ache, weak, as if my heart was overly stressed if I done the least little thing. My experience with effexor has been a mess. I'd have days on 75 mg 1 a day that I'd wake up early and be n a cleaning jolly mood until someone else stepped n that space whether by phone or n person. Well except for my boyfriend. But by the end of the day I'd b tired and easliy irritated. I was also on 200 mg wellbutrin sr 2x day. My pshyc Lowered my wellbutrin to 150 mg 2x day after one mth of the 400 mg my regular doc had prescribed and raised my effexor xr to 225 mg a day 3 75mg pills n the morning. Things ain't so good. Can't tolerate much. My man touching me, my child talking in a loud tone, or someone even just interrupting me with myself time which I want all the time it seems. Think I'm gonna call my pshyc.

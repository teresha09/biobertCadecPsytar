The medication fooled me. I lost a job spiraled into depression and anxiety. Prescribed Cymbalta and thought it helped overcome depression and anxiety because of job loss. Reality is I became a zombie, robot. I didn't truly feel, or really care about things I had a passion for. Less anxiety and depression but less life. Just existed. Went through motions. About three months ago I went off cym. sick of losing track of what I wanted to say, feeling of numbness, the constant need to sleep. I could sleep two days straight and still feel tired. Confronted by family about what kind of quality of life I had. Slowly trying to get out of the hole with no med except occasional xanax. I want to feel even if it is depression. Exercise, trying to look on the bright side even when habit is not to, talking with family about feelings that is what is saving me.

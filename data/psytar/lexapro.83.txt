BEWARE. the generics of Lexapro are NOT all the same. They vary greatly in how effective they are. Most generics are made overseas in India or China. I had to go to three pharmacies before I could find one that did not cause serious side effects, Again, please be very careful when changing over to the generic of Lexapro. The best manufacturer I have found is Lupen.

haven't experience any side effects. I tried several anti-depressants before sticking with Effexor XR. One thing I learned real quick was not to miss a dose. I did that twice for a couple of days and ended up in the ER with nausea, pain all over my body and DEEP depression. I wanted to die. I'm grateful for this drug. I have gone through counseling and feel very well. I would like to get off but the withdrawl symptoms stop me. I don't even want to think of the darkness that could take me to. I guess I'll take it forever but that's alright. IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE IF YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE!

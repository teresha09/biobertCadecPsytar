Pupils dialated, a little shaky, I started at a low dose and quickly went to a high dose because it wasnt helping. I had a little bit of a problem falling asleep last night. I havent had any bad side effects. I feel so at ease, I love it. I dont have fits of rage anymore, I am calm when things happen and that way I deal with them better. I dont worry about things, I take things one step at a time. I dont feel tired, I feel like I can talk to people, and express emotion with out feeling funny about it. Over all it has helped me greatly. I think that this drug is great, but only for certain people

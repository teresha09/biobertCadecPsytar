First three days nausea, mild trembling feeling, no appetite. After about five days all of these completely disappeared. I have been on every anti-anxiety drug available over the last 12 years and I NEVER stay on them because I usually always gain A LOT of weight within a couple of months, and two, I am unable to orgasm. I workout 4 - 5 times a week hard, watch my diet, and every other drug has always made me gain. Paxcil was the worst. Cymbalta has been literally a miracle drug for me. For the first two weeks I had to take xanax every now and then until the cymbalta built up in my system to fight the anxiety. I have been on it now for five weeks and feel great. My mood is better, the anxiety is gone. I have my appetite back, but have not gained any weight at all. For the first two weeks I could not orgasm, but that has also gone away. I could not be happier. I am on a drug that makes me feel great, my moods are evened out, no weight gain, and I can enjoy sex! Good luck to you all!

Nausea, Blurred Vision, 3 to 5 hours sleep, Suicidal Thoughts. Be careful with this medication. This was my first anti-depressant medication. Very scary drug. I was unable to sleep, had blurred vision, and felt sick to my stomach. Unable to eat anything significant for the 3 days. While driving to a friends house crazy thoughts kept happening. Stopped the drug after 2 days and next day was feeling better. Would not have been able to work (software developer) if attempting this drug during work week. Currently on Nortriptyline which seems to help.

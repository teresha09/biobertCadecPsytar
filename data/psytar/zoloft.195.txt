The first dose gave me a "spaced-out" feeling that continued for a few more doses. I also felt uncontrollably sleepy for over a week. I had no desire or energy to do anything but sleep. As I got adjusted to the medication, however, I felt less sleepy. I am managing much better, and I can stay awake longer now. By the end of the day, however, I crash. Overall, this medication has made a big difference in my life by managing my symptoms and allowing me to work and have a social life again.

First two weeks but disappeared shortly afterwards . increase in anxiety, weird floating feeling, sweaty palms, nausea, heartburn, waking up in middle of night for no reason, sexual performance issues. Side effects after first four months . weight gain, yawning fits, daytime sleepiness. Before taking Lexapro, I was having panic attacks at least twice a week. I went along hoping against hope that the panic attack I had one day would be the last one. I would go along a few days without one and then be so disappointed to have another one. I was having a lot of these while driving and I was beginning to avoid driving to prevent them. It was getting quite debilitating because my work requires driving to different places at times, Now, for the 10 months I've been taking Lexapro, I've only had three instances where I could feel myself going into a panic attack . this is a huge decrease. This Lexapro treatment has at least allowed me to continue driving and going to work, Without it, I would be a mess right now. Most of the odd side effects went away the first few weeks after I started taking it. The remaining side effects . weight gain and sleepiness . I'm in the process right now of deciding whether or not I want to live with them. The alternative right now would be having the weekly panic attacks again which I am in no mood to continue. I also notice not worrying so much anymore about things . I used to worry about everything, Problems don't seem so overwhelming. I also have noticed that I don't get so upset and rattled by other people's rudeness or nasty comments anymore. I'm more likely to just shrug them off and go on my merry way.

I experience frequent headaches as well as insomnia-which has led to a mild addiction to sleeping aids. Vivid dreams and nightmares. Total loss of libido, Fogginess/Forgetfullness, Teeth clenching. Anxiousness and anger. It has definately helped with my uncontrollable crying and incesant thoughts about death, However, the main reason I take it is for anxiety. At first it helped, but now after a few months, I cannot tell a difference. I've also gained about 60 pounds because I became more depressed and freaked out, leading me to just give up on a healthy lifestyle as well as failing an entire semester at my university. I am being switched to Wellbutrin XL.

Vastly increased moodiness, extreme levels of excess energy, minor hallucinations, irritability, reduced sex drive, lasting dissociative symptoms. I was on Zoloft when I was in high school, and it worked fine. Went back on it after a couple of years of no meds, and it made almost all of my symptoms worse. I had multiple recurrent thoughts of suicide, the worst self harm I have ever done, all culminating in an overdose on the drugs, leading to an overnight hospital stay. Zoloft works really well for some people, just make sure you have people around to see how you react to it.

took 150mg of Zoloft with 300mg of Wellbutrin together. When 1st started I would sweat alot. I was always hot. No sexual desire at all and terrible amount of weight gain. I am blaming the 40 lbs gained in a year on the meds because I was active and watched my diet. It did help the depression though. I was able to stop taking it just a couple weeks ago after being on it for 2 years or so. Emotionally I feel great now but went through HELL withdrawal. Vertigo,nauseated,skin crawls,severe headaches,crying spells,brain. I feel this drug worked well for me, just had a hard time coming off of it.

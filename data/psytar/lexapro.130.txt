Dry mouth, subsidized sex drive, first few weeks experienced tiredness and felt very foggy. I am 21 years old and this medicine has worked wonders for me. I started this six months ago amidst a battle with depression, in addition to having bulimia and trichotillomania. My weight issues have almost COMPLETELY disappeared (within weeks I saw differences) and the urge to pull my hair has dwindled. I lost my mother three months ago, and I don't know what I would have done if I weren't already on Escitalopram. No urge to return to my old habits despite my unbelievable stress level. My benefits definitely outweigh the side effects

Terrible night sweats (most nights), non-existent libido, concentration difficulties, unbearable discontinuation syndrome if I miss a tablet. There's no doubt that Effexor XR saved my life, however long-term use is not the best. My moods are stable, but I'm now mildly and continuously depressed because of the two main side effects - lack of libido and bad night sweats. It's ruining my relationship, and so I'd really like to get off it but am terrified due to the side effects, and not knowing what I'll be like when I'm off it. I didn't have a choice but to resort to this drug, and I owe my life to it. It has made my life bearable, but introduced new problems which I never had before.

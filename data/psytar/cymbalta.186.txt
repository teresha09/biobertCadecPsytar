Insomnia, decreased appetite (though that's a good thing in my case; the depression had me overeating). Cymbalta has changed my life. I didn't realize how bad my depression was until looking back on it-I wasn't motivated to do anything, had paranoid delusions, was always achy and unwell, and was just generally unhappy. I started Cymbalta after finally dragging myself to the doctor at my mother's insistence, beginning on 30mg for one week and moving up to 60mg I noticed a difference within the first week. Now, it's an incredible change; I feel like I'm a *person* again. I have been experiencing insomnia due to it, but with 25mg of Trazodone, that's evened out wonderfully. I'm so happy with this medicine!

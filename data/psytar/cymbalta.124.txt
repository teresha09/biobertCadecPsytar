didnt want to eat first two weeks, cant sleep, felt sick when working out/shaking. when i first started taking cymbalta i started at 30 mg and i took that for a month. and i saw no differneces in my depression but my mom said i was a little happier. then i was given 60 mg and i have been taking that for about 3 weeks now and i have highs and lows all the time. i either wanna go out or stay in bed. it really hasnt made me much happier though. but i hope with time it will help me.

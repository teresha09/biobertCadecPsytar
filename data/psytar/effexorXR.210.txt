Mild constipation, difficulty maintaining an erection and delayed orgasm. Coping with these side effects is nothing compared to coping with severe depression. I've tried many other medications and this is the only one that has ever worked. The main issue I have is that over a period of several months, it loses its effectiveness. I often wonder whether these medications "pooping out" for about 30% of people is a clue to the underlying biological cause of depression, Ultimately, I'd like to find others that work so I can switch between them when one stops working, However, I'm yet to find another one that works.

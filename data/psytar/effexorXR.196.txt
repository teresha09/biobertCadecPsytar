difficult in reaching orgasm. Neither Paxil nor Wellbutrin had any significant effect on my depression. Effexor XR works very well to date at 225mg/day but I an concerned that over the long term the drug may not continue to be effective. I have started CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) to supplement the medication. (The Feeling Good Handbook by David D, Burns, M,D.)

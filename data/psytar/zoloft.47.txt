Initially loose bowels, headache, flu-like feeling. Ongoing loss of appetite, insomnia, jittery feeling, increased anxiety and depression. This was on 50mg a day. Obviously not the SSRI for me. It seemed to make me worse rather than better. Switched to Luvox which I am finding much more beneficial.

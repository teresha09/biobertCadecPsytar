flatulence, loose stools, and a really good reaction in evey day life. it rocks. check out the BLTC Good Drug Guide. it is a blockbuster that will need augmentation with a stronger DRI in order to reach its fullest potential with my unique chemistry. bottom line is- it works with at least 4 weeks to get used to the new blueprint. i highly recommend it if you are in chronic pain or EVEN- feeding off of the exogenous opoid. Love.

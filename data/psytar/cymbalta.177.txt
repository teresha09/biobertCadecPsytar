Initially; dizziness, brain zaps, weight loss, nausea. These dissipated after a couple of months. Now I have night sweats and my body temperature has increased. My weight has stablised and I am seven pounds heavier than I used to be, but I have a decreased appetite. As others have said, the withdrawals happen very quickly - I get pins and needles in my face and tongue (how bizzarre!) within hours of missing a dose. I have found that this has helped my depression and anxiety very much. I no longer have suicidal thoughts (which i had lived with for fifteen years), I no longer am extremely anxious and negative. It has not helped my hypersomnia - I can still sleep for up to 14 hours a day. Am looking at changing my meds (I also take a small dose of Lamictal every day) as I am very unmotivated and slightly depressed at the moment but I think t could be to do with my life circumstances which aren't great right now.

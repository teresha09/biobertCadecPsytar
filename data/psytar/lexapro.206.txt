When I forget to take it on a daily basis. I have a general feeling of malaise; I also had some insomnia when I first started taking it (that was resolved by taking in the morning instead of the evening). It took me a long time to admit to myself, and my doctor, that I was a little "off" (I am talking about 20+ years here). I took another anti-depressant with disastrous results. I began to take Lexapro about a year ago and, except for some initial bumps at the start. I am doing really well on it! I am much happier than I have been in years, and actually enjoying life for the first time in many, many years. Lexapro may not be for everybody. I am glad I did not give up when the first meds failed. If you have a similar experience with meds, do not give up, For me, it has been certainly worth it.

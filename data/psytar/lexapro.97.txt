Started it after just going off 15 mg of paxil, tritrated down within 3 weeks. At first it was great then as the paxil slowly left, I feel too up, even though I wanted to feel awake which I really neverdid withthe paxil. I am currently at 2,5)  I tried going up to 3.  and after 3 days felt like I couldn't stop moving, but was hard to focus so I did things like wash my kitchen floor etc. I called my dr. office they told me to drop it down to 2.5 until they could see me. I was able before last night to take it at bedtime and fall asleep, last night I had to take a tiny bit, less than 1/8 ativan to get to sleep. Will this go away?

worked like a low dose of extacy for about 1 mo, then became complacent. No feelings at all, happy sad, nothing. then went suicidal. I stoped cold turkey after taking 150 ml 5 days later ended up in the ER for a suicide attempt, next day, paramedics at my house for talking suicidal thoughts, 7th day tried again spent 2 1/2 weeks in phych word. I couldn't even remember acting this way. I'm now back on it and "stable" , but planning to wean slowly very slowly off it, take coution when weaning, start only as a last resault IMO, herbals, exersize and therapy, spiritual or other wise, anything but a drug as ADDICTIVE gravely so as this type, Yea, don't talk to me about so called addictive medicationsie opiates or benzos. I never tried to kill myself coming off those. and never went insain either. feel free to contact me I'm a research junky when it comes to meds! I've got more to talk about!

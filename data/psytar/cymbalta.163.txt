Was just taken off Celexa because it did not do anything for me except for the horrible side effects. Was switched to Cymbalta. Have only been using 3 days, but have experienced No side effects yet-hoping thats a good sign! Havent noticed the meds working yet, but no pains compared to celexa. Hoping this one is better!

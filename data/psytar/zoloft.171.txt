The only side effect I have noticed is it makes me sleepy, so I take it at night and sleep well. I do have occassional, mild headaches but nothing worth stoping it over, that's why there's Motrin. Zoloft has changed my life. Saved my life. I went from taking Xanax .5mg 3-4 times a day, to not taking it at all and still not having anxiety attacks. It took a good 4 weeks, but I am so calm, comparatively speaking.

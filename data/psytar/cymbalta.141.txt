On 90 mg I had sweating at night so that my clothes are drenched, somtimes multiple times at night. I also have had a lot of gas and some constipation. On 60 mg, I was irritated with my boyfriend when he wasn't being irritating at all. On the whole, this drug has helped very much. The side effects for me are less than for Effexor.

Erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, abnormal dreams, can't stay asleep,forgetting to eat, extreme nausea, headaches and reoccurence of ocular migraines. Intially worked great for pain. Still works for the other two. Thought most side effects would be gone. Instead most seem to be getting worse.

Wild, life-like/real dreams; definitely CANNOT skip a dose (wicked headache and dizziness). Taking at same time is important, but at a low dose (150mg for past 3 years), can manage to go about 8 hours beyond usual dosage time with little effects. The 'broken sleep' however is frustrating. and if a dose is missed, wow, the dreams and pyschedelic 'views' the mind kicks out when eyes are closed are absolutely incredible, scary, affects you the next day, etc Who needs to go to the movies? Perhaps this is what Hollywood could use - keep a dream journal; you never know! All that aside, at a remission-type dose (150 mg or less), if i don't start experiencing very unusual health affects, i intend to stay on this drug for a long while. Mental illness (that is  lack of serotonin) is just like any other defect the human body can have. So, why not? It helps me immensely, and the side affects are tolerable, as long as i don't provoke them by missing a dose. Enjoy life however you can with whatever aid you need!

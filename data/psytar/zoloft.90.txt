Lack of ability to obtain erection (before taking, it was almost as if I could just think about something sexual to obtain erection, now my girlfriend and I both need about 10 minutes of heavy passionate kissing to even get horny (she is also on Zoloft now), Ejaculating problems, mainly sexual side effects. Has helped me with my anxiety and depression, though I still do worry alot, maybe more than before. Bad sexual side effects. I'm going to talk it over with my doctor to see what I'd like to have done.

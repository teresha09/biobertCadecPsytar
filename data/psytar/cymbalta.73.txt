changed from effexor, which solved my depression and anxiety, because I started sleeping all of the time after being on it for about 10 months. Cymbalta did not solve my sleepiness and just added many uncomfortable side effects. I have intense sweating, sleep disturbances, feeling spacey and dizzy, sleeping 2-3 hours during the day because of "brain fuzz". Getting off of Cymbalta has been very difficult. I have been tapering from 60 mg per day, to 40, and now to 20)  I feel dizzy whether I take it or not. I read that taking benadryl or clariton helps with the withdrawal - and it really does.

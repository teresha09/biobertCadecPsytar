constipation, drastic mood swings, 100% helped my anxiety and panic. didnt do much for the depression. This drug is the devil. Ever try getting off of it? You would think you were going through heroin withdrawals. Im lucky I didnt die b/c I just stopped cold turkey one day and the brain zaps puking and overall feeling you get is like no other. I will never touch an antidepressant again. Just to think that I went through all that physical and mental anguish to get off a drug. it could not be safe to take on a daily basis

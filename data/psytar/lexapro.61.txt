increased anxiety, more panic attacks, uncontrollably bursting into tears. i started at 5 mgs, felt like i was on speed for the first few days. 2 weeks later the anxiety had increased into panic, the Dr. had me skip a day then start back at 2.5 mgs daily. that was ok for about 3 days then i started having constant panic/anxiety, as well as crying a lot at innappropriate times. i stopped taking the lexapro, the anxiety has lightened a little bit, but the crying hasn't. i haven't taken the lexapro for over a week.

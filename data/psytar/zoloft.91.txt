sweating, dry mouth, increased anxiety. worked wonderfully in the beginning. took away all the depression I was experiencing for three months. after 2 years, I built up a tolerance and had to increase it from 50 mg to 100 mg. the depression was creeping back again. I found nutritional supplements to deal with the depression. I am still on 25mg of Zoloft b/c it is IMPOSSIBLE to come off of. withdrawal is HORRIBLE! It does nothing for the depression anymore but my body is too used to it to stop it

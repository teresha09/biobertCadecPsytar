Strange itchy rash on my skin-scared for life now. swelling of legs and ankles, eventually entire body, bloating, constipation, loss of "caring". no sex drive,  insane sweating, dizzyness, heart palpatations. These all occurred gradually as the dose was upp'd and when I complained to the dr's (three) they didnt know what to do and at first denied it was the effexor- eventually weaned me down- and all smptoms disappeared. Cost hundreds of dollars to find out this medicine was CRAP!

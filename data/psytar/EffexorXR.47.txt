While on the medication I would experience painful shocks through out my body when I would miss a dose even by an hour. These shocks radiated from my forehead, to my teeth, and then the rest of the way down my body. They were so bad I would involuntarily turn my head. My depression never got better while on this. I experienced weight gain and loss of sex drive. When I finally went to the doctor and demanded to be taken off of Effexor she started to slowly decrease the dose. Even cutting the dose in half caused me to have SEVERE shocks all day long. When I went down to taking none the withdrawl effects were so bad. During the first week I could not be around my 4 year old son because of extreme anger! For the first two weeks I could not drive and could barely leave my bed. I constantly felt like the room was spinning. After about six weeks the withdrawl effects decreased. I have been off of Effexor for about nine months and I still experience withdrawl effects atleast once a week. I swear these shock effects never go away! I would never recommend this medication to anyone. It nearly ruined my life. Please use serious caution with this medication. Feel free to email me, I have been through it all with Effexor. (Also, I am now on Elavil and it has helped me more than anything my doctor's have ever tried.)

agree that it isnt really effective for me either. I feel sluggish,unmotivated,and still have depression,aniexty and pain. I need something that helps me with all those things. I was on Lexapro for 4yrs and it stopped working. I also, agree that if I stop taking the Cymbalta I feel those "brain zings" and fuziness,that is withdraw symptoms. If I dont take the medicine at the same time every day or forget a day, I will expreience withdraw and its horrible! I am going to go to a psychotrist to see if there is something else that will help me.

it took about 4 weeks to really start working. in that time i had strange feelings almost like i was on a high at times. pupils were hugely enlarged, clenching my jaw alot, suffering alot of dreaming i never use to. sleeping alot about 12hours a day, coffee doesnt keep me awake anymore. have experinced headaches alot when i wake up mainly, increased appiette, weight gain of course. no lose of sex drive. effexor works very well. has aken away all my anxiety and depression. makes everyday life much more mangable. im happy with the result, is certainly worth the side affects. the side effects are less common and some totally gone already. Very grateful for this drug!

Irritability. This is a great drug with minimal side effects. I am able to socialize with people without any anxiety. I am less self-conscious to the point where I could care less and am comfortable in any social environment. As for the depression, it is gone and i'm able to function as a happy human being. Only problem is this med makes me slightly irritable to sounds, sudden talking or disturbances ever so slight as they may be while I'm trying to work. There's a little bit more lack of concentration on my part which can be mistaken for short attention span because this drug puts me in a state of La La land and it's hard to snap out of it bc it's such a nice place.

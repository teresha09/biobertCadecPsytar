severe migraines, extremely low sex drive, mania, excitability, difficulty sleeping, weight gain, rapid thinking. i think there are better drugs out there now to treat anxiety and depression, this drug has far too many side effects for anyone to feel comfortable taking it. however, it does make your mood much better. thoughts of suicide decreased. i generally became more optimistic and active. if you can handle the side effects this drug does wonders. i came off this drug successfully 2 years ago. but am now on celexa (which has way less side effects) and clonezipam for panic attacks. in conclusion there are better drugs out there to treat depression.

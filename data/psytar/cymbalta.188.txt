Possibly tiredness/sleepiness (though I've felt that way long before starting Cymbalta). By far the best antidepressant/antianxiety medication I've tried. Both my depression and anxiety have abated significantly, though there is some of both left (plus the tiredness, which I suspect could be depression-related). I'm already at 120mg and would like to go even higher. My sexual performance has improved greatly, as has my concentration and even driving skills! It's really interesting how the same compound affects different people in so many different ways. I definitely recommend at least trying Cymbalta.

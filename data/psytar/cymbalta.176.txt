Dry Mouth, chronic forgetfulness, a mental 'haze', it feels like I am peeing every liquid out of my body. Overall, I really feel positive about this drug, at least for myself. It has been powerful at curing anxiety, depression and mental clutter. I feel as if my mind is constantly a cool calm pond. I do however feel a blunting of my emotional life and I wish that were not the case. I also take trazadone with the cymbalta, does anyone have experience with these two drugs together? if you do, please email me! I hope everyone is finding healing even if it is not through this particular drug.

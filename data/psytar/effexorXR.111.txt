weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea. My doctor said that Effexor would be the best drug for me since it is made to help depression and anxiety, both of which I have. It didn't help my anxiety at all but I definitely felt less depressed while on it. It almost made me feel like a care-free kid again. However, I gained 25 pounds on it and this just fueled my depression even more since I was close to being overweight before going on it. Going off it was hell too. I got the "brain zaps" that other people have mentioned. I also just felt like crap for days. I definitely don't think the good outweighs the bad. I wouldn't recommend it.

None whatsoever, except more and more confidence that my chronic depression will never return. I seem to have been born depressed. Unhappy, often suicidal throughout childhood and adolescence. Anti-depressants became available when I was in my twenties, and I was on and off them for years. The older types worked up to a point, but there was always an underlying feeling that depression would emerge, and sometimes it did. But since Zoloft, I've been able to live without that fear. It's totally changed my life. A wonderful drug.

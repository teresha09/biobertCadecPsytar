Loss of appetite and weight (5 lbs in a month). I didn't really have any negative side effects, or if I did, they were very mild (slight "loosening of the stools", which was good because I tend to be, uh, constipated all the time. a little sleepy in the afternoon in the first few weeks. dry mouth in the first week). I consider the appetite supression/weight loss and anti-constipating effect to be *good* side effects! Cymbalta helped my life. I went from having explosive mood swings, to being more easygoing and stable. The Cymbalta is also taking care of more personal and specific issues that I feel a little embarrassed writing about. I feel less needy and fearful of abandonment.

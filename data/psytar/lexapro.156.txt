None that were enough to notice until recently. I went off for a few days and noticed that I was able to have an orgasm again. Before I went on it I was always able to, but I never put two and two together to realize that the medicine was the reason I couldn't anymore. It has really helped with my depression and my ability to handle things. My anxiety is much calmer, although still present. I haven't had any episodes or panic attacks since I started it, except for a three day period when I couldn't get my prescription refilled, so went without. When all is said and done, and after taking so many other AD's that have really messed me up, this is by far the best, with the least amount of side effects.

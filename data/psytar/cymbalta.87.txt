can't stop yawning, wake up in the middle of the night, am so tired during the day. like a zombie. i've not even been taking it for a week but i dont know if i can deal with the side effects. im exausted during the day, waking up in the night. i've tried taking it in the am and pm and its all the same. totally constipated, i mean big time. anyone else had these issues? have they gotten better? im worried, i can't go on like this for long

Total loss of libido, horrific nightmares, insomnia, weight fluctuations, irritability/angry all the time. I was on Zoloft for about 4 months, and after the first 2 weeks I had absolutely no sex drive. After the first 3 weeks, the nightmares began, and became increasingly gorey and horrific, to the point I would become paranoid. I began sleeping in odd patterns, for only a few hours at a time. My weight would increase, then decrease, then increase again. When I went off of it, it was because I had become so angry and irritable I couldn't be around anyone because I would become violent at nothing.

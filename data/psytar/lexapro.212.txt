None. I have a feeling of wellness and contentment; no anxiety attacks, no weight gain, no night sweats - i just feel like my old self - optimistic and upbeat. I think this is the best Rx I have ever had although I have no experience with other antidepressants and have only taken Xanax once a day - but I've never felt better!

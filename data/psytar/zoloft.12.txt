Suicidal ideation, weight gain, suicidal tendencies, tingling fingers, dizzy, tremor, insomnia. I was given zoloft from my pyschiatrist and started at 50mg per day and was steadily increased to 100mg. After taking this for three weeks I began to not process thoughts well and found it difficult to concentrate and function well. I felt very shakey in my hands especially in the afternoons making tying a bow or a knot very difficult. I found work hard to focus on and suffered some memory difficulties. I was carrying out 'risky' behaviours and after 4 weeks of taking it I ended up in the emergency department of the hospital twice in 4 days for over-dosing. This medication has not been at all pleasant and when put in hospital the doctors increased my dose to 150mg and this was terrible. I am now on my first complete day with taking no zoloft after slowing decreasing the dose and the withdrawal isn't pleasant but survivable so far,  Headache, slight confusion, temperature and feeling very tired are some of the withdrawal symptoms I have so far felt but they are better than what zoloft was doing for me. Zoloft was prescribed to me to help with depression and if I knew that there were reported cases that this anti-depressant could increase the risk of suicide I NEVER would have agreed to take the medication. I have learnt that it is very important that you should ask your doctor questions when they prescribe you a medication and that it is essential to research the side effects. I had never previously carried out any risky suicidal behaviours until after taking zoloft for 3 weeks.

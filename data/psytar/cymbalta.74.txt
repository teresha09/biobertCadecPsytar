Lethargy, lack of concentration, brain zaps, nausea. Initially helped with depression but after a while just felt spaced out and tired all the time. Didn't realise to begin with this could be side effects as had worked to begin with. Just gone cold turkey and had one week of horrible brain zaps, mood swings and nausea. Now I feel great like I'm alive again, better than being on the tabs. Wish I had never started.

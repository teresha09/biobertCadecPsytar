Worst side effect of this med is insomnia. Cannot get off to sleep although very tired. Drowsy during the day. At first I had constipation and lethargy. Apart from that in comparison with other meds low side effects. After about 4 days on this med I n oticed a definite uplift in my mood and my anxiety was a little lower. I was surprised because I had just stopped taking Sertaline and expected to be suffering some withdrawal from that so was pleased with how i felt. I have been on this medication for 11 weeks today and my mood began to dip about two weeks ago. I am very disappointed because I have had a few meds since I stopped Seroxat a year ago and have not had any therapeutic effect from them and really thought this med would be the one to work. I am up and down on this medication in general. I have to admit that my anxiety is not as bad and my depression is not as bad. I don't cry as much which is a bonus but I do feel like crying at times during the day and I really hoped to be feeling much much better at the 11 week stage.

Brain buzzing within 12 hours of missed dose. Less and less libido and sexual function over the years. Made my drinking into raging alcoholism. Detoxed and AA'd up and stopped smoking. Too bad about sex, alcohol and tobacco, I enjoyed them all ,but Effexor has really helped me. Now questioning if I should start tapering off and slowly transition to edible medical cannabis. Sounds like horrible withdrawal, as head buzzing suggests immediate pain and mental torture.

Increase in panic attacks / anxiety,  weight gain (10lbs), headaches and vivid dreams. The side effects from this drug were from day one but I was told by my doctor to give it a chance. Six months later and I don't feel any better. I have decided to wean myself off. Yesterday I started taking 25mg and I feel horrible. I hope others have better results from this medication but I would recommend trying something different.

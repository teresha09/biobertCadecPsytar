Lack of motivation, VERY TIRED all the time, memory loss-feel scatter brained. I take citalopram which is genaric for lexapro. I started on 10mg and continued to have anxiety so the dosage was increased. I take it at night and have found that it helps me sleep. When I don't take it, (if I miss my dose) I have difficulty sleeping. I feel so tired all the time that I don't have the energy to do basic every day household tasks. Then I feel guilty for being lazy. I have to take a nap every day. I also have difficulty remembering things and feel scatterbrained. I will think of something that I need to do and less than a minute later I have forgotten what it was that I needed to do. I have a Dr.'s appt. soon and I will share this with my doctor. I would like to try a different antidepressant because the loss of motivation and being tired all the time is making me feel lazy, worthless, and almost as depressed as before I started taking it.

initial side effects lasted a week or so - bug eyed, dizzy, nausea - just like with any anti-Dep. The lasting ones: decrease in appetite, change in food cravings - from carbs to sugar - down 2 sizes :) this is a weird one. when i would find insects and spiders in the house, i would kill them. now i either leave them alone, or take them outside to a spot i think they would like - i said it was weird! when i forget to eat, i get the shakes - low blood sugar. my finger pads seem wrinkly - like a person forty years older than me. I have gone the fruit route - i will eat 4-5 apples/oranges/pears in one sitting, no diarrhea or constipation. Takes care of the sugar craving - i used to eat vegies lots and hardly any fruit, now it's reversed. Also eat less meat - kind of grosses me out now . but  i crave pecans, almonds etcIncreased mood SUBSTANTIALLY - although still very reactive around menstruation. Sometimes feel JOY - dancing around the house, energetic, feel good about myself, most times just feel balanced, calm. Much improvement from the suicidal ideation, dysphoria, depression. bit borderline too, and obsessive negative self thoughts. it's the FIRST antiDep i've tried where there's a POSITIVE difference! From the sounds of the other posts, it doesn't have this effect on everyone. I would encourage you to speak to your doctor right away if some of those really bad side effects occur - this drug is so new, there's no long term studies on it, so we don't know how it reacts with different symptoms, different physiology. For me, i noticed within 2 days that the rumination was all but ceased. I've never noticed any previous AntiDep's effect until well over a month (prozac, effexor, celexa and wellbutrin combo) and none of them has actually made me feel GOOD about myself.

In a constant fog, inability to concentrate, no libido, memory loss, night sweats and vivid nightmares(in the first month, stopped eventually). This particular drug did not work for me. I have been on 60mg I just dropped to 30mg today and will be coming off of it to switch to welbutrin. I am a full time graduate student who works full time. I have never in my life had such a hard time getting motivated (even with anxiety and depression). I am constantly forgetting words and always feel like I'm in a fog. I barely remember the last 3.5 months. I would sit down to study for class and forget what I just read. I would suggest if you are starting this drug to do so when you have no important engagements going on, so that you can see how this drug effects your memory and concentration.

have gained 30 lbs since I began taking this. I have never been overweight before. Also, oddly my cholesterol has jumped up over 50 points in the last year. Which can be a side effect of Cymbalta. Very sleepy all the time. Hard time focusing and if I miss dose look out. I become very irritable, not to mention I experience brain zaps similar to paxil withdrawal. Having been involved in a lawsuit with glaxosmithkline due to the effects of paxil withdrawal I am very concerned about stopping this drug. However, I am not willing to be a depressed huge woman either. The drug has helped with the depression, however the side effects are awful. If you think giving a depressed woman who has never had a weight problem, an extra 30 lbs to carry around is a good idea you would be mistaken. So mostly the weight issue is a big deal. I swear the drug makes me very, very hungry. It is quite bizarre. Also, I also just seem mostly numb which is pretty scary. I dont like feeling like that.

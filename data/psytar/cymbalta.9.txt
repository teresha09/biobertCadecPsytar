Sweating, dry mouth, anxiety, brain zaps, severe brain pain, (different from headaches) dizziness, foggy, anger, no sex drive . AT ALL, nausea, weight gain, throat pain and exhaustion. The side effects from coming off of this drug are much worse than the side effects of being on this med. ALL of the aforementioned side effects plus I feel like I have the flu. I have not been able to work, take care of my husband or daughter, take care of my house or even make meals on a consistent basis for the past 5 weeks while I am trying to get off of this med. I cannot think, spell, or follow through on simple tasks. The first week, I went from 60mg to 30mg - I almost divorced my husband of 8 years. The second week, I almost killed myself. the 4th week I went from 30mg daily to 30mg every other day. I am currently in week 5 of my detoxing and it has not gotten better. I cannot go shopping, people in the store are "too close to me" and I become very fight or flight. I should have been in the hospital at least twice. Thank God my husband loves me and is willing to supervise and take care of me.

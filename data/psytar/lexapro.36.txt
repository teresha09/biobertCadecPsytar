I didn't take Lexapro long enough to evaluate it for its intended purpose, because I found the sexual side effects intolerable. I not only lost the ability to orgasm, but stopped having even the slightest feelings of arousal. Near the end of the two weeks I could feel my frustration as a sort of dull, heavy ache in my stomach, but I couldn't do anything about it because I was basically numb, a nonsexual being. It was frankly disturbing, and I think going off the drug and feeling healthy and whole again has done more for my depression than any medication ever has. I've heard great things about what this drug can do for depression, but the side effects are a real possibility. Just make sure you consider whether or not they are worth it for you.

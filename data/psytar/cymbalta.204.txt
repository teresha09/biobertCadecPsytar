Tired, tinnitus, restless legs. I started taking Cymbalta for depression and also pain from interstitial cystitis and vulvodynia. Since I am very sensitive to meds, I started by opening the capsule and pouring most of the pellets out, recapping it, and taking the small amount left. I gradually worked up to 30 mg a day. I felt instantly calmer from Day 1, and had improvement of bladder urgency/frequency/spasm. I have since reduced dose to 20 mg per day. I initially had exacerbation of restless legs, which went away over time as I adjusted to Cymbalta. I can get tired and spacey in the afternoon when it kicks in, but I gladly take the med because it has given me my life back.

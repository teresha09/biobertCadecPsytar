Vivid dreams/nightmares, possibly some tiredness. Some mild effects on discontinuation but nothing too severe, although I did come off it slowly over two or three months. Greatly improved my depression in a month or so after fluoxetine only gave a slight improvement. Effectiveness seemed to level off after a while and further improvement was slower - another six months until I could start working effectively again.

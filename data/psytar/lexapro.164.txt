Dilated pupils, sleepiness, dizziness first few days, inability to cry, anxiety. Overall lexapro worked really well for me. I started on the 10mg and upped that after two months of little change to the 20mg. Within two weeks i felt much better. As far as mood goes, i didnt feel any real highs or lows, more of a constant comfortable feeling. At times I felt very anxious for no reason and at different times in the day but these negative side effects paled next to the depression i was stuck in before lexapro.

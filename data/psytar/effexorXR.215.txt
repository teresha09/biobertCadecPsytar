Goofy happiness in the beginning, temporary lowering of sex drive, shakiness. I take 225 mg. of Effexor XR. It's the best anti-depressant I've ever taken. I took Lexapro once and it majorly screwed me up. Paxil made me gain weight, and Prozach interfered with my sleep and didn't seem to do much. I'm comfortable with this drug.

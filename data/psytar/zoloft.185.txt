Fatigue. Withdrawal (if w/o for more than 3 days). Weight Gain. I tried a couple other anti-depressants before Zoloft that either made me even more depressed or didn't help at all. It took a couple of weeks for me to realize much of a difference with Zoloft, but it has, without a doubt, saved my life. The only complaint I have is that I found myself eating more than usual which caused some weight gain, but none that can't be managed without increasing exercise and eating healthier. I had some fatigue when first starting the prescription, but I no longer notice it. Just make sure that you DO NOT go without Zoloft for more then a couple of days once you have been on it for awhile! The withdrawal is AWFUL! Due to various causes, I went a week without my prescription and had terrible vertigo, insomnia, nausea and irritability. Otherwise, great!

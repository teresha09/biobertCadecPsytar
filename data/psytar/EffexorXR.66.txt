Throat ulcers, ear ache, jittery, nervous, migrane when I missed a dose, dangerous interaction with Incocid suppository (for pain from tear in disc) blood in stool, vaginal bleeding. Felt flat and no interest in life, Didn't make me any happier or less anxious. Side effects were awful - antibiotics for ulcers and ear ache, stomach cramps, period screwed up. Am weaning off, and is going well. Took a 37.5 pill apart, removed 1/4 beads. Bad head ache next day, but after that OK. After 4 more days on 3/4 dose, took 1/2 beads out and had no side effects. Will drop to 3/4 beads out in another 4 days, then stop.

dizziness, nausea, extreme loss of appetite, diarrhoea, lethargy, tingling in fingers, sleeplessness, low blood sugar from loss of appetite. Took 1 50mg tab at 10pm and woke at 1am feeling weird. Was bedridden that day, Didn't take another tab but still feeling side effects a day later. I know Zoloft works for a lot of people, but I am breastfeeding and have a 2-year-old to look after, so I can't keep taking it in the hope that the side effects might go away after a week or 2)  I need to be able to eat and function. The doctor told me that it seems I have a hypersensitivity. My depression is not serious so it looks like I will have to go down a more natural path to help myself.

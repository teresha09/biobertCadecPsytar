Stomach problems early on: bloating, nausea, constipation. These disappeared after a few weeks. No side effects now accept for yawning. I have been taking 75mg dosage for a year now and it has greatly improved my depression. The negative obsessive thoughts playing over and over in my head have disappeared completely. I have not experienced any sexual side effects. I was on a 100mg dose of Zoloft prior to taking Effexor and it completely crushed my sex drive. I no longer have that sense of dread every morning and I am able to handle the stress of daily life. I would definitely recommend Effexor XR.

with zoloft of 50mg then 100 mg, I experienced a decreased sex drive- and inability to have orgasm. more tiredness and irritable when I had to get up. monotone in emotion. I felt like I existed- monotone. nothing was funny and nothing made me too upset either. just shrug my shoulders as my living room curtains caught fire from melted heater wire that sparked. (not kidding- literally oh well. ho hum!) It did only allow me to think about one subject at a time other than my previous 9,846 thoughts in 2 minutes. (which was good)

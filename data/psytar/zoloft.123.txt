loss of libido, drowsiness. Before being prescribed Zoloft I was very depressed and suicidal. After a few weeks on Zoloft it was amazing to me the way I felt (that is , not constantly depressed). I think it did make me sleepy because I was constantly napping, but that may also partly have been carried over from when I was depressed and unmedicated (I slept to avoid how I was feeling). After a year or so I realized I didn't have much of a libido anymore and after about 2.5 years on Zoloft I finally changed my medication, but if it wasn't for that side effect, I most likely would have stayed on it.

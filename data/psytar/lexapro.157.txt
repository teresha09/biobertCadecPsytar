VIVID DREAMS! Woah what is going on here? For a while before I started taking lexapro, I couldnt remember my dreams at all. I was beginning to think I'd stopped dreaming! Within a few days of starting lexapro oh my god the dreams are vivid, intense, long, and complex! And I can remember every detail of them when i wake up in the morning. It Feels like im living in 2 different worlds, my daytime world and dream world. Each seems as real as the other, So bizarre! I must say I absolutly love this side effect, I cant believe its been so marked though I didnt expect it at all! Makes going to bed a lot more exciting. Also feel very happy, confident and a general sense of wellbeing. Have had no negative side effects, glad I tried it.

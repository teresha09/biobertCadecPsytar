oh gawd. I was on Paxil for 12 years, but THOUGHT it was wearing off. Think menopause is a huge factor in this. i have only been on generic zoloft for about a week and a half. our doggie is very sick, and i was up with her all night last nite, didn't sleep. My stomach is a wreck. burning and diarrhea all nite. had to pee every five minutes all night. I feel very speedy and my heart is racing. My stomach is on fire, and feels like i drank draino. I hate this so much sometimes i don't know how long i can go on. Just dont know yet. Paxil seemed to calm me down so much. Yes i gained a ton of weight on it, but i haven't on the zoloft so far.

Inability to gain an erection without significant physical stimulation from partner; even then, orgasm was infrequent. I began to get twitches that felt like bodily electricity, which was not only startling and uncomfortable, but also led to me developing an incapacitating social anxiety that used to be only nominal, and i still retain a modified form of the latter two side effects to this day (it's been a year and a half). I firmly believe that it should not be approved for medical use unless some method of effective test is made to make sure that it won't worsen your state while you're on it, but even more importantly, after you get off of it. I had to begin taking a different prescription (Lamictal) to counteract the side effects that it gave me for a couple months longer than I was on Effexor XR, and now they are TOLERABLE, but I still feel a social anxiety unlike anything I'd ever experience before. When I get nervous (which is often) my body will literally move in coordination with other people's bodies. I used to describe it as if vague, kind of abstracted strings were pulling me and everyone else around me in accordance with eachother. When I told my doctor that he most likely misunderstoof and thought I was exhibiting schizophreniform symptoms, when in reality, I didn't believe in any of it, it was merely the only way I could describe the sensation.

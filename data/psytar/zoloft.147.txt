Night sweats (really annoying), loose stool (no big deal), difficulty reaching orgasm when i first when on, then it returned to normal for years, but in the last 6 months orgasm is very elusive again. Took a few years to figure out right time of day to take it to feel ok, evenings work for me (always been 50mg). When i miss a day i feel very spaced out, thick, groggy, sad. Zoloft totally changed my life for the better. The difference was like night and day with feeling like i had a purpose in the world and motivation and joy. in the last 6 months I feel like Zoloft has stopped working. i have great social anxiety again, lots of self-doubt, have not felt joy in a very long time. even though zoloft worked well for so long i have wanted to go off for years due to trendyness/social stigma and belief that i should be able to handle this w/o meds but have had much trouble with the withdrawal the 2 times i tried. now that i am feeling bad again i wonder if it would be a good time to try going off because the drop might be less than if i were feeling great. i never liked the idea of being on zoloft but i can't deny that it worked brilliantly for years.

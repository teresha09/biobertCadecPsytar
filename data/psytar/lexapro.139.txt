nausea, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping. I initially took Lexapro at 10mg with my Wellbutrin in order to stop a debilitating depressive episode from progressing. The side effects got better after 2 months. Then I got lazy and wasn't consistent about taking it and whenever I tried to take it again I'd deal with horrible nausea, so I weaned off. After about 4 months of being off, I noticed my irritability and anxiety increasing, so my new doc suggested a measly 2.5 mg dosage. I'm dealing with mild nausea but feel the calming affects. I need to hang in there. BUT I think we all need to remember why we turned to anti-depressants in the first place . because we were severely depressed or ridden with debilitating anxiety that affected us living a good quality of life. If life was better off the meds than perhaps you didn't need them as bad as others do. When my side effects are difficult to deal with, I remember that a debilitating major depressive episode, wanting to curl up and die, is FAR worse and I am thankful that I have options to help me live a normal life.

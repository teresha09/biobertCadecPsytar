COMPLETELY DESTROYED SEXUALLY FUNCTIONING . EVEN AFTER GOING OFF THE DRUG . PROBABLY PERMANENT! Just TWO tablets of Lexapro 10mg completely destroyed my sexual functioning, probably for life. It's called PSSD: post-SSRI sexual dysfunction. This evil drug will not do you any good . it's no better than placebo at treating any mental health condition. And there is a chance that it will give you PSSD, which as the name suggests persists even after you stop taking the drug, Just google 'PSSD' and you'll see what I mean, So please: NEVER take this drug, not even one tablet. DO NOT TRUST YOUR DOCTOR. IF YOUR DOCTOR TRIES TO PRESCRIBE YOU THIS DRUG OR ANY OTHER SSRI ANTIDEPRESSANT, GET UP AND WALK AWAY.

turned into a raging maniac, i had nausea, cold/hot flashes. I felt out of control, & disorientated. Also, headache,crying, insomnia, and I can't tell you all the side effects. I would never ever take this drug again, nor would I recommend this to ANYONE! This is a BAD drug, they should have better warnings about the side effects.

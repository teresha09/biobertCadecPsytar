 continued. Apparently there is a limit! Guess I went on to long. I eventually weaned off by opening capsules and pouring about half out. and reassembling the capsule. It took me about two months to get to the point where I was taking about 10 granuals every three days. then I quit altogether. People are still having problems with this medication even after being off of it for 8 months or more,  Please don't take this medication. Getting off this DRUG is a living hell.

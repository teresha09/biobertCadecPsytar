The 1ST time taking the Lexapro . Slight nausea and somnolence, 2ND Time . Nausea; vomiting; suicidal thoughts; slight schizophrenia; tremors; increased anxiety; agitation resulting in violent thoughts; psychosis. This medication orginally did wonders for my wellbeing and anxiety, However, I needed to come off it as it often impaired my memory . to the point where school was becoming arduous, Then, when I got worse, they put me back on it, That time, however, was the most horrendous experience of my life. I sat with my head over the toilet vomiting whilst slurring random words and throwing toiletries at the people who surounded me. Apparently I refused help because I thought they (my parents, and later, the nurses at ER) were trying to poison me. Be very careful about this drug, but it helped me immensely the first time, Be wary, but don't be completely close-minded either.

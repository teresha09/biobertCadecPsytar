LOST MY MIND COMPLETELY, FUNCTIONING AT 28% CONSCIOUSNESS, I ALMOST JUMPED OUT OF A WINDOW, BUT I TOLD MYSELF: "THIS IS NOT ME. THIS IS THE MEDICINE". AND CALLED 911)  I started on 10 and I felt very depressed still, actually worse, panicky and extremely anxious, then the pdoc doubled my dose to 20! then I lost it, The hospital told my husband I was functioning at 28% consciousness, I wrote all over my body, talked to the walls, cried HARD, and screamed "dont touch me!" I was TERRIFIED, felt like I was intoxicated by some horrible drug, they admited me for 5 days, then I quit this drug and started on LAMICTAL which saved my life I now feel content and complete. :-)

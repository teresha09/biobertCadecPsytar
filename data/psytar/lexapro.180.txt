takes much longer to climax. at first some 'hung-over' feeling. It's very hard to cry. It has reduced my anxiety attacks to near nothing! Automatic anxiety occasions (elevator rides, big crowds) now don't trigger automatic responses, which helps a ton. I started with 10mg and moved up to 20 pretty quickly, with very little problem. The pros far outweigh the cons, and I've found this drug to be very good for a drug-sensitive person like myself.

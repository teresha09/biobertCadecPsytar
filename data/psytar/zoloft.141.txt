Started w/ 50MG to build up to 100/day and during first week period experienced horrible side effects; tremors, nausea, etc After that week, no side effects whatsoever. Only long term effect is that I can't cry - literally. not that I'd want to be cry often but it is a good stress relief and now, nothing. Overall I'm glad I'm on it, have been for around 4-5 years now. I can tell I get less angry at things and sometimes less sad - the only complaint is not being able to express sadness. I'd still recommend at least giving it a shot.

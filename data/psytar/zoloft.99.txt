Vivid dreams, night sweats, extreme lethargy, decreased interest in sex, feeling emotionless, nausea. I felt an almost instant change with this drug, but ended up spending a lot of time in bed feeling tired and indifferent instead of going to class. I guess that's always better than feeling suicidal, right? No sex=no good, though.And you'll probably scare your partner away anyway after they realize that you've soaked yourself, your pj's, and the sheets through with night sweats. After you threw up 30 minutes after taking your pill. Wellbutrin worked MUCH better!

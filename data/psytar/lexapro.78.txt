I'm jittery and feel like I'm going to jump out of my skin after taking my dose. A few hours later that seems to cease and I become really tired. Having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep already. Clenching my jaw has gotten worse since I've been on it. I feel like I want to go run or jump up and down or something to get rid of this excess energy. I am only on Day 2 of Lexapro and taking 10mg/day. I feel really strange but am hoping I even out some after being on it for awhile. I also had some really strange images while trying to go to sleep last night. I wasn't asleep so I can't call it a dream/nightmare, but definitely strange nonetheless. I imagine this is what it feels like to be on crack.

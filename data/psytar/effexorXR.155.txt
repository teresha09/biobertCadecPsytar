Sleep issues, also I now have a harsh edge to my inter-action with others. This was attributed to anxiety. so have a med for that. Generally seems to doing a good job with mood, though I'm not impressed with the sleep issues (couldn't sleep. so now I have a drug for that). I've also lost about 30lbs 240 down to 210lbs (Not that I complaining on that one). I've been through most of the SSRI's. this SNRI seems to be working . at least for now. But now you see where once I took 1 med for mood, I now need 3 .

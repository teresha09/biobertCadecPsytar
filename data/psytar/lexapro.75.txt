Had dry mouth for a few days, it might have aggravated a stomach problem I already had but I'm not sure. Started feeling the effects after 5 days or so . I basically needed to use it to get rid of a severe anxiety that I let gradually build up on its own before I did anything about it, but I could feel it working in situations where I would normally get a little anxious as well. After about a few weeks it leveled off.

at start dry mouth& metallic taste; started clinching jaws which causes headache, tooth and gum pain & neck pain. The dry mouth is very insignificant compared to depression. For those people who do not understand why anyone would take these drugs with all the side effects YOU HAVE NEVER SUFFERED REAL DEPRESSION. It is necessary to find one with fewest side effects and everyone is different. What can you live with? I am assuming the Cymbalta is the cause of the clinching. I had the same thing with Lexapro along with some other things.

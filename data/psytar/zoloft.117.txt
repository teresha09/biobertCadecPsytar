beginning it I was first on "cloud 9" then I leveled off and life was back to normal. I have gradually incrased dosages and now I take 200mg/day. again I'm depressed and ho-hum not to mention I've gained 20lbs I wholeheartedly blame on the zoloft. I feel great otherwise until I hit this low. Question? is there a higher dosage of zoloft that brings you back to life after 200mg that my doc. isnt telling me, or is it time to quit and change? On occasion for money reasons i run out of my prescription for zoloft and may go days w/out it. i suffer from upset stomach, headache (always over my lft eye) terrible highs and lows and hot flashes. is this typical?

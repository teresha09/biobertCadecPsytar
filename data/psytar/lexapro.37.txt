Increased anxiety, SERIOUS constipation (for which even laxatives and epsom salts barely helped) and stomach cramping, my stomach hurt all the time, disturbed sleep and trouble falling asleep, fatigue, headaches. Had worsened depression and suicidal thoughts after going off this med- don't know if it's due to the Lexapro or my cycle of depression, just seems worth noting. I couldn't get past the side effects- have no idea if it would've worked for me.

stayed awake for the first week or so. None others. Don't ever run out. Cold turkey is dangerous. After 3 days stopping 100 mg a day, I should not have been behind the wheel. A whole weekend went by and I didn't know where I was or what time or day it was. A nurse at the emergency room that checked me vitals, was the only person I remember, beside my two children. She looked at me and said I was being ridiculous, "Zoloft is a day to day medicine and there is no effects from stopping!" This was 5 years ago and I will never forget her stupidity or condescending face. Both my children started laughing at her. On the positive side, I'm much more relaxed in tense situations. If I'm cut off in traffic, I don't flip anymore. I let them in and give a polite wave. the anger is just not there.

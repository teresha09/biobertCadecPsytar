Made me really forgettful, weakness so bad it was a struggle just to comb my hair. My useless former doctor just dismissed my concerns. Also made me extremely angry. It takes months to get off this poison (which is another thing the useless doctor conveniently didn't tell me). Should be pulled from the market.

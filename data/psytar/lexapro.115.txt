weight gain, spaced-out/zombie-like/"dream"-like feeling, sweating, increased appetite, sleep too deep. This drug does help me. My life is easier, lighter, I'm capable of working out the issues that lead me to depression, when before all I could do was cry. I'm also taking vitamins that increase seratonin level in my body, Omega3, Flax Seed oil, 5HTP, B12)  I started Lexapro with a 1/4 of the 10 mg, then increased it to 1/2; now I'm back to 1/4; eventually I'm going off of it. The reason is weight gain. I've gained 10 lb of pure fat in the past year, Literally FAT. I exercise, I eat healthy, Although, 4 months ago I quit smoking/drinking alcohol, after that I'm craving food all the time, mostly sweets. Sweating for the first 7-8 months was AWFUL. I felt on fire. I'd sweat so much, I had to change my clothes a few times a day. Nights were the worst, especially before my period, Now it's almost unnoticeable. Sometimes I feel zombie-like, like life is out of focus. I have vivid dreams, but I always had them & I enjoy them. The draw back is sometimes my life is so dream-like, while my dreams are so life-like, that I constantly confuse what I dreamed & what I lived. Sometimes I sleep so deep, that I can't even wake up to use the bathroom. I would lie there a little awake (mostly asleep), with my bladder nagging me to get up, but I wouldn't be able to for hours. When I do get up . I'm so drowsy, I walk as if had 5 bottles of vodka. Since scientists know very little about moods, mental issues, feelings, soul-ache, etc I'd say there's no right medicine & they all affect us

At first: Headache, nausea, trembling belly, loss of appetite, nervousness (All went away in a few weeks.). I'm also on Xanax (have been for many years). 10mgs daily Lexapro has helped my anxiety and has chilled me out. I don't get as upset about things nor do I worry myself crazy anymore. I am, however, TIRED! Then again, with Xanax and Lexapro, I suppose anyone would be. Vivid dreams but not nightmares. Libido is low but orgasm is possible. Considering adding Wellbutrin for some energy and to counter slight weight gain. My mood is definitely lifted although my energy is really low.

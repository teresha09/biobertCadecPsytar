night sweats, very cool sexy vivid dreams, dizziness if I miss a dose, nothing serious compared to the good feeling I have when I take it regularly. There was some initial loss of sexual drive and difficulty achieving orgasm, which I attributed to menopause. Thankfully I have a wonderful husband who helped me past this and now sex is just as good or better than it ever was. I love it. I don't ever want to stop taking it. I take 78mg per day every morning and I like myself on this drug. I don't lose my temper, go into ranting raging fits anymore. I may drink more than I did before, but still nothing serious, I do get a buzz quicker, but still would never have more than 1 drink through the week, or 2 or 3 on a Friday evening.

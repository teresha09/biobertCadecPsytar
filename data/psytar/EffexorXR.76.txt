Over the course of months I gained 20 pounds, tried to get off the meds 3 times had had such awful side effects, electric shocks through body, blurred vision, major headaches. Discountinuation of this drug is like going on a detox, it was horrible. Finally off of it for 2 weeks now and starting to feel more like myself

Fatique (hard to get out of bed in morning), difficulty (but not impossible) to have orgasm and weight gain. I have been taking meds for 6 years to treat anxiety and depression. Celexa knocked me out. I was so exhausted I couldn't moved. I felt drugged. Lexapro was the perfect drug for me. I took it for four years. I felt like myself on it (not drugged or sedated at all). I stopped taking it because I missed having orgasms and was sick of the weight gain and fatigue. That was a mistake. I tried Cymbalta with good effects (especially for muscle tension), but always felt like I was on medication. Did not feel natural. Went off cold turkey. DO NOT DO THIS! IT WAS HORRIBLE! I felt like I was going through heroin withdrawls (not like I know what that is like). Cymbalta was just too powerful for me. I have been on Wellbutrin for one month. No sexual side effects, but it has not helped my anxiety or depression at all. I am going back to my old friend Lexapro. It has very mild side effects when starting or stopping. It is mild but very effective. Guess I will just have to exercis

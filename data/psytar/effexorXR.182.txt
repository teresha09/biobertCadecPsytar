This medicine has helped me so much, My anxiety, depression, and panic attacks are gone. However I do have some negative side effects. I am currently trying to wean myself from 75mg to 37,5)  Eventually I want to get off of it. If I skip a dose of effexor xr I have night tremors and mood swings. I have gained about 15 lbs in 6 months. My hands are swelled. I have had a loss of sex drive, Also. I did have extreme hair loss and itchiness in the beginning but that could have been due to hormones as well.

Dry mouth. Was finally prescribed this after many years of depression. In that time I had been prescribed: Seroxat, Efexor, Prosac, Prothiadin, and another whose's name I no longer recall. For me this had the lowest side effect profile of any medication I have ever had. I realize this will not be the same for everyone, but it has worked very effectivley for me for some years now.

no seriously noticeable side effects at 300 mg daily several years. could miss a dose or two and no problem. but 4 days without suddenly and i'm all over these boards looking for withdrawal symptoms! only problem i can isolate during normal usage is blurred vision. others like insomnia, no libido, and sweats appeared prior, with menopause. took Concerta with it 4 months then discontinued for overstimulation/insomnia. also discontinued hormone replacement therapy. very hard to separate all these things out but generally I loved my EffexorXR at $187/month. did I mention the poverty side effect? Preferred Prozac, felt clean and words were at the tip of my tongue. But on second later use it didn't work at 20 mg, so tried Wellbutrin - a very very dangerous disaster for me and quickly stopped it. Started Effexor two years later and Dr. warned if stopped it might not work again. Feel like it's time to try, tho - at 1:30 a,m, haha.

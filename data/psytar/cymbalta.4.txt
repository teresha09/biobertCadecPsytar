Severe stomach cramps, upset stomach, dizziness, spacey. It's been horrible! I have tried a lot of different depression meds, am taking Lortab for pain 2xs a day. I really hoped this would work so I could get off narcotics for pain but I would rather take the Lortab than this garbage. This med should never have been approved by FDA.

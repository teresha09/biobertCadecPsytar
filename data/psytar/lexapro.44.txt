I have been losing handfuls of hair every time I brush, wash or run my fingers through it. I now have to brush my hair outside by the trashcan and I only wash it twice a week. I've become more depressed about this and cry every day. I am also so fatigued that I am sleeping several times during the day, as well as 8-9 hours at night. One month ago at my doctor's appointment, he said that hair loss is not a side effect and to continue the Lexapro. My research finds that many people suffer this side effect. I have stopped taking this medication.

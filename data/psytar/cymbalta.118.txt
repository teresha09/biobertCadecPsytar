decreased appetite, fatigue, maybe a little "foggy". It's only been four days, but I'm not experiencing anything negative with this drug. Not feeling much happier, but I know it takes a couple weeks for the drug to kick in completely. Due to my depression, I am always fatigued so that part doesn't bother me. And I'm 50 pounds overweight, so I'm not complaining about the decreased appetite! I'm taking 30 mg each morning, I'm sure I'll be posting again in a week or two.

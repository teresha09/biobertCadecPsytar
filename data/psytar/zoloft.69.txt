Headaches, mood swings, grinding teeth, feeling low, loss of concentration,anger, suicidal and omicidal thoughts. I started taking it at 100mg and then went on 50mg due to headaches I was also using endep 50mg for insomnia and pain. At the moment I can say that I felt better on 100mg. I still feel depressed and have negative thoughts racing through my mind so I don't think 50mg is really enough for me.

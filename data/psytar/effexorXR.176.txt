Sweaty hands & feet Euphoria. This medicine has saved my social life. It has saved me from making terrible mistakes at work and around my family. My manic depression has driven to do things any normal person would never even think of doing and it seems as though I cannot live without the medicine. I think I may have to have my dosage up'd to the next level because the bad dreams and sudden outbursts are coming back I've noticed. Thank you Venlafaxine. You've saved my life and my daughters. I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone though. I'd like to think of it as a "last resort" type. I've tried countless other meds. But this is the only one that does the trick.

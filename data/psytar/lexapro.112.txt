Dizziness, Dry mouth, Yawning. All left after a couple of weeks, Erectile disfunction. Inability to orgasm. Lack of sexual desire. 2 months now and so far so good. Lexapro has certainly lifted my mood and allowed me to think clearly and comfortably. It's also got me more motivated,out of my chair and into some mild exercise. I intend to stay on it for a while. The only side effect that's really concerned me is the sexual one. However the inability to orgasm has been addressed by use of a prostate massager which works well despite being embarrassing. I'm slowly beginning to have erections again so I expect that eventually the orgasm inability will resolve itself. Another reviewer above mentioned in his case it took several months. I began with ten and moved to twenty after a month. I don't intend to escalate. I'll report again at 6 months.

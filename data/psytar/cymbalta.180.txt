Increased sweatiness, extremely oily skin and acne, weight gain, strange dreams, alternating insomnia and then fatigue, and constipation. After taking Cymbalta for about 8 weeks, I felt a lot better mentally. I recently was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Cymbalta is a terrible choice for PCOS patients as it can raise insulin levels (which causes weight gain and lots of the other side effects that are already PCOS issues). I have just weaned off this onto Lexapro and don't seem to have any serious side effects. My skin is clearer and the sweatiness has subsided.

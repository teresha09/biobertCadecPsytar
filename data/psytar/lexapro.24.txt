From the moment I swallowed this pill I experienced a dry mouth and dry eyes. But more alarming was the sensation of pressure behind my eyes-like they were going to pop out! Also I had a severe inablility to concentrate which made it impossible to do my job,I am a Registered Nurse. I also found myself making a bizarre sucking motion with my mouth-possibly from the dryness? I took myself off this drug and started a strict regimen of exercise and improved my diet which did wonders for my depression and anxiety. Do not take this drug.

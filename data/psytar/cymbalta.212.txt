was on this before and had weight loss. i was on cymbalta a couple of years ago and thought i could live without it boy was i wrong. my moods changed i didn't care if i ever got out of bed and i was down right miserable! if you stop taking this the withdrawal is awful. my doctor decided to put me on lexapro because when i get feeling better i think that i don't need anything and lexapro didn't have withdrawal effects, but i gained 35 pounds on it. when i was on cymbalta before i was able to lose weight and not feel hungry all the time. i don't think i will ever stop using cymbalta again. looking back when i was on cymbalta before it was the happiest i have been in about 10 years. in the past i have been on several medications and nothing worked as well as cymbalta

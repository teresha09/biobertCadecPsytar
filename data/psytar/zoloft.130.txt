Initially, some insomnia which subsided. Long term: low libido, fatigue. I currently take 200mg. Zoloft has made all the difference in my life: I'm no longer depressed. The anxiety I experience is somewhat resistant, however, and Zoloft isn't really helping. My doctor has prescribed a very low dose of Seroquel (off-label) to help the anxiety, but I haven't taken it. Its an antipsychotic with lots of serious side effects (I'm not psychotic). So, I may need to try a different SSRI to see if it will help with the anxiety.

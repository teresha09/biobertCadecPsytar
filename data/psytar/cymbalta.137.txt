Night sweats, constipation, taking longer to climax during sexual intercourse. I am glad that I started Cymbalta before I came to this site. I have only been on Cymbalta for 10 days but I am already starting to feel so much better. I've gone years and years being depressed, sometimes severe sometimes moderately. The disheartening thing is that the people who are most likely to post on sites like this are the few that have had bad side effects. However, remember that everyone is different and out of ALL those taking this medication only 20-30% end up with severe side effects if any at all. Every person physiologically is different and processes meds such as Cymbalta differently. There is a balance. there are many who are taking this medication and have not had any side effects at all and even the ones that have, it has been worth the side effects. I am hoping that my experience with this med continues and that it gets more effective as time goes on.

Sleep. its all I want to do, however, unable to rest for more than an hour at a time. so sleepy on 60mg 1x/day. I lost 25 lbs in 3 wks. Had to be put on valium so I could eat. 5'3" - was 125 now 100 even. not good. (It put me to sleep for an hour, then I would wake up and eat a little) Don't want to eat, had to force myself. Hazy, do not care attitude. Felt like I was sitting in a chair watching the world go by. I'm amazed that I have not been fired from my job. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE! IT IS HORRIBLE! I simply don't understand how the FDA could allow this medicine on the market. The withdrawal symptoms are nothing sort of a nightmare. Electrical shocks, headaches, tremors, frequent urination, nausea, major anxiety. Cannot get straight answer from anyone regarding how long these withdrawal symptoms will last.

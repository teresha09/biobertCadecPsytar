I posted back in July after I went up from 1/4 of a pill to 1/2 of a 10mg. Side effects were sleepiness and excessive sweating. I DID make it to the beach! Twice in less than 8 days. I haven't been 45 mins. from my home in 39 years! The 2nd time we went to the beach (1 hr, 45 mins away) we spent the night. My sister was so proud of me she got us a beautiful oceanfront room. I NEVER thought I'd see the ocean again, already have a reservation for 5 days next summer. I thank God for Lexapro. The excessive sweating seems to have stopped about a week ago, sex drive has been as great as always, and right now at 5mg Lex with 1 1/2 mg of Alprazolam a day. I seem to have discovered a miracle!

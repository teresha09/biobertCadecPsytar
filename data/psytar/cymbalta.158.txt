little sleepy at first, then dosage was increased from 30mg to 60 mg after the first week & I felt better. Loss of appetite, weight loss, a bit of a headache about an hour after taking it. This med has really helped me. I'm able to focus and this is one of the only anti-depressant meds that doesn't make me feel zoned out and spacey. (I've taken Wellbutrin, Lexapro and Paxil in the past with mexed results.) If you can deal with the initial side effects, which seem to subside, this drug is worth it. That's just my opinion. Good luck, everyone.

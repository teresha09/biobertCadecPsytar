The first two or three days, I felt dizzy and tired. But that has gone away. I will be going back to the doctor in 2 weeks, I am on 10 mg and I think we will have to go to 20mg, because I still feel anxious (chest is tight, heavy sighing.). I like this anti depresant better than Paxil which made me a zombie. I am able to sleep at night on this drug, my sexual drive is fine, and I don't seem to eat out of stress.

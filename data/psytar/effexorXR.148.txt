No real side effects besides a little more lethargy/sleepiness than usual. I only experience a little nausea/dizziness if I miss a dose. Has worked relatively well and is the only anti-depressant I've been on. I take it at night and any time I miss a dose, I tend to have very vivid dreams and night sweats. Sometimes the sweating gets so excessive that I need to shower in the middle of the night. But again, I only experience this when I forget to take the effexor.

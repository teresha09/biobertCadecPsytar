didn't really experience any side effects. I had a headache that lasted about a week. I also had dizziness and exhaustion, but those went away in a couple of days. This has done wonders for my extreme sensitivity and irritability. Anxiety and social anxiety virtually gone. But skipping a dose is BAD. Headaches, nausea, exhaustion. Along with mood swings, irritability, etc It's basically all the symptoms I experienced before I started taking it. Except for the physical ones

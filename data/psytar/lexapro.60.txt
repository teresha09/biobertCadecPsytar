nausea, diarrhea, sweating, head in the clouds, stoned feeling. I took it before I went to bed, Days 1 & 2 were good- felt relaxed; Day 3 I was spacey, stoned; Day 4 I got severely sick: woke up at 3am sweating, diarrhea, heart racing, mind was racing (almost psychotic thoughts), had a panic attack because I was so scared, almost went to emergency room because I could not relax for 4 hours straight!

Difficulty climaxing! Weight gain, decreased enthusiam/energy to do things. Hard to be motivated, Increased appetite. Lexapro helped me get through a very rough time in my life and for that I am thankful. Now I am trying to get off of the meds (pretty rough) to alleviate the negative side effects and return to a more natural state. I recommend Lexapro.

The only side effect I have is occasional tremors, mostly in my hands. This occurs almost exclusively when I am over-tired. Effexor gave me back my life. I had been on just about every antidepressant out there and none worked. I couldn't leave my house due to anxiety and sometimes couldn't even leave my bedroom. I wouldn't bathe, brush my teeth or wash my hair. I thought about suicide nearly every day. I wasn't living; I was just existing.

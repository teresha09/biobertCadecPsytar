Deep-end mania. For the first 3 weeks, life was getting a lot easier and I started to hope that I was going to come out of that long tunnel of depression. But at about 4 weeks, I became fascinated with geology and I could not stop picking up rocks. My pockets were full of rocks everyday. I would take time off work to collect. It took me a full 12 weeks to fully realize how delusional I had become (as opposed to moderately depressed but not delusional, before taking Cymbalta.) Hm, what else, yes. I was also missing meetings! My career was at an all time low! I kept getting fired. (But I was happy, well sort of.) If you have the time and inclination to become an artist however, this may be the drug for you. It really works great on depression. I also got incredibly fascinated with digital photography. I was extremely prolific. I loved what my senses were bringing me. I've got kids though and if I kept taking Cymbalta, I'ld be living in my van by now and not paying child support.

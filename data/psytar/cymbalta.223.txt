For the first two weeks I was very nauseous. After the two weeks the neuropathy pain subsided and had a loss of appetite which was a good thing for me. I continue to lose weight right now I have lost thirty pounds in about 8 months. My mood is better I now get excited about things that are good. I do have sleeplessness but, I am willing to deal with that in exchange for the pain, weightlose and the feeling of happiness. In the past I have taken zoloft which I could not tell that it helped with the depression. My Doctor which me to cymbalta because of the neuropathy pain I was having. I feel this drug has been a great help to me.

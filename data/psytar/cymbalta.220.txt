At first, nausea. for 2 years, I've suffered from something called lymphocytic colitis (my white blood cells attack my colon), causing severe diarrhea. Pdoc & gastrodoc both think that something in Cymbalta makes it worse, but can't find anything in research. So I take Loperamide/Immodium daily to counteract, and it works fine if I stay away from fiber. I also have increased sex drive, more pronounced PMS, and odd sleep patterns. PLEASE don't be put off by my symptoms. This is by far the best antidepressant I've been on, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Now we've had to augment with Lamictal for regulating mood, because I'm going thu severe stress, and the combo is really helping me.

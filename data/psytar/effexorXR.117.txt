right now, what I'm dealing with is the inability to climax. never noticed that before but since going back on Effexor, I do. Can get very turned on but just no release! Bummer! I, too, have dealt with withdrawal symptoms on several occasions (prev took Effexor for ten or so years), and agree that missing a dose can turn one into Mr. Hyde. My current doc agrees that it's one of the hardest meds to come off of, and promises that if we taper, it will be slower than crap. He felt I'd been trying so many different meds that didn't work, and that I hadn't been on a high enough dose of Effexor in the past for it to be effective. so far, seems to be helping keep my mood more stable but I do notice a kind of deadening of emotions- I know that was a concern of mine before when I took it. Better than wanting to OD, I suppose. Am using yoga and chanting to help relax as well.

agitation; hostility; suicidial thoughts; increased pain; increased depression; muscle spasams in legs and feet; dry eye; increased blood pressure; heart palpitations; increased anxiety, etc Switched to Cymbalta because of claims that it helps with pain. Side effects were terrible. My prescribing MD assured that a second increase in dosage was needed. He believed the drug rep but not me. Finally, was able to see a board certified psychiatrist and switched to Lexapro. Huge improvement and almost instant end to leg spasams. The industry needs more honesty about Cymbalta side effects-it made my liffe a livng hell for 2 years. Wonder how much those drug reps make per year in bonuses.

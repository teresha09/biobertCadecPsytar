Did not help my depression and caused me to have suicidal thoughts. I was taken off and experianced withdraw so bad that I now back on and slowly coming off. I had chest pain, heart palpitations, vomiting, headache, rage, mood swings, and more. Other drugs can help just as well, without the terrible side effects

Fatigue . I was tired, and felt extra exhausted all the time. I started at 5 mg and after a week moved up to 10 mg.  After experiencing those fatigue symptoms and not being able to do, well, anything, I was moved back down to 5 mg which only helped temporarily. I'm starting Effexor now and I hope that will help.

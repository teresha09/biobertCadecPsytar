I've been on this medication for years. Major constipation; fiber does not help. Confusion is really bad, lack of concentration is very bad. Short term memory loss. Loss interest in doing anything. I can sit for hours day in and day out with no interest in usual pastimes. I lost touch with all my friends because I have no interest in seeing them. However, I have no anxiety while taking the medication. Is it worth it? Helped me with anxiety. I don't think anything helps with depression. I've taken one medication after another for 20 years.

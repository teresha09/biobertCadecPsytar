sleeplessness, 'fuzzy thinking', lack of concentration, lack of memory, unrational behvaviour, extreme anger/agitation, oh ya, sweats too . where do i start? this has been a nightmare . i wish i had been smart enough to do research on effexor BEFORE i went on it . my mood swings were extreme , yelling, cursing, swearing . calling the people i love the most, the worst names i could . throwing things across the room in anger . not good at all . the med made me more anxious than before , agitation, sleeplessness . led to prescriptions for other meds . before i knew it, i was dependent on sleep meds, and was being prescribed tranquilizer type meds too . i suppose if i had not been on the effexor, i would have been clear-headed enough to know not to take anything else, but i couldn't form a coherent thought for the life of me . i was off work for the longest time, finally got back to work and tried to wean off the med , that's when it really hit the fan . in my 43 years previous, i had never had any trouble with violence or extreme anger . but i made up for it in the last year and half on this med

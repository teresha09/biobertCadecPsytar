Nauseated the first week, then went away. Cymbalta makes me very tired and listless,which in turn made me gain weight, which in turn made me feel more depressed. I can't concentrate well,foggy thoughts,poor memory,and don't want to socialize much. Not suicidal anymore, but I don't think Cymbalta had anything to do with that. That has always come and left on its own without meds. I have a subtle ringing in my ears. No real benefit from this med, So I am now weaning myself off. I've tried many kinds of anxiety/dep med and nothing works for me,every one so far has been just a "sleeping pill" and I dont want to sleep my life away. Not impressed with Cymbalta. I dont think I'll ever find something that makes me feel content and happy and help me stop worrying so much, without the sleepy zombie feeling.

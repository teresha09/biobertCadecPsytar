Slight nausea at first - but went away after a few days. Extreme sleepiness in the evenings during the first week - no problem now. Still have a night or two during the week when I can't sleep or wake up @ 2 a. m. I feel better than I have in a very long time! I have so much energy during the day and find myself laughing again. My moods are more even and I am alot nicer to be around. I don't explode when something stressful happens . For example: my 8-year-old spilled a whole glass of coke in my car and my reaction was "Oh well, let's clean it up." Before I would have had a STROKE! I love this drug, but how long is it safe to take it? Does anyone know?

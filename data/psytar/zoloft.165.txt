Had lots of trouble at first. Anxiety increased tenfold, had panic attcks, disconnected/spaced out feeling. But it all went away eventually and I started feeling great. I love my zoloft. I am only on 50mg but my insomnia is gone, my anxiety is under control, and I get depressed less often. Initially had some sexual problems, but remedied that by taking it at night before bed (and after sexual activity) so that the level of the drug would be at its lowest point in the evenings. I may be seeing some very slight weight gain but I can't say for sure that it is the zoloft.

Drowsiness. I've been off an on different antidepressants for years, and I plan to stay on Zoloft. It prevents the mood swings I used to have, without making me feel spacey. I feel normal and rational when I am taking it. I ran out of it for 4 days, and experienced lightheadedness and a crying spell until I took it again. I am taking 25 mg a day.

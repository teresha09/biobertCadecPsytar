bruise easily, terrible joint pain, still have days that I have no desire to get out of bed. I have been on Effexor XR 150 for 5 years. During the holidays I increase to 225)  I don't get the withdrawal symptoms with this doseage change. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced the bruising and terrible joint pain. I have had all kinds of blood work done, and my tests are all normal, so I think it has to be the Effexor. That is the only medication I take. It makes you look like a crazy person when your labs are normal and you still complain of pain. The doctor must think I am crazy or making it up. I know the pain is real.

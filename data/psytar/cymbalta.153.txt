HOrrible migraines but i have had migraines since early childhood,This medicine just caused more frequency and higher degree of pain with headaches,Best medicine for depression that i had ever taken and worked instantly. I must say that i felt the happiest i had ever felt in my life except for the extreme migraines,Due to the frequency of the migraines i discontinued cymbalta ,wish i could go back on it. I did suffer some withdrawl depressive symptoms after stopping the medicines but felt better in about two weeks

Originally I was prescribed Zoloft for depression & anxiety attacks and was given 50mg dose from the start. Within a few hours I was trippin from the side effects. I was unable to carry on a conversation, racing thoughts, room spinning, looked like a zombie, emotionally numb. I felt i was high, nauseous for 4 days. Finally my Dr. switched me to Lexapro. The first day was great, no side effects whatsoever. Until I woke up nauseous, as soon as I ate I was fine, 2nd day: no side effects. I was social, but that night woke up at 2:15 sweating and in a terrible panic attack(not from a dream) but heart racing, swallowed breath, felt emotionally traumatized. but quickly fell back to sleep, Day 3: great! Social, happy to have company, emotionally well & stable, Again, woke up at 4am (no anxiety) for no reason but fell asleep an hour later. Over all I'd say these side effects are much easier go deal with than before & am very happy to be on the route to a steady, happy life!

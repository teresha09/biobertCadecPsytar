Decreased sex drive (but no problem performing), delayed orgasm (however, orgasms seem a bit more intense), moderate night sweats (primarily legs and groin area), slight tremor in right hand (only briefly and immediately upon waking up). My experience with Lexapro has been extremely positive. The side effects have been very minor for me. The most striking thing about Lexapro compared to other anti-depressants I have taken is that I do not feel "medicated" or somehow altered. The improvement in mood and outlook feels perfectly natural.

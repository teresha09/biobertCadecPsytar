Immediately gave relief of peace, loss of depression, no more sadness, and overall terrible body pain disappeared. I felt happy for the first time in more years than I could remember. But I am so tired, all I want to do with my spare time is sleep and Now I am suffering severe anxiety daily as never before that I try to treat with Clonozpam. I am worried that the anxiety attacks will cause me to do something totally illogical and dangerous to myself. Don't know what to do, Don't want the depression or to have someone else step in to act "on my best interest" but need to resolve anxiety issues. No trouble sleeping; had been on Ambien CR whiich had topped working, but now I sleep all the time. Is there a smaller dose than 30 mg that might lower the anxiety and sleepiness?

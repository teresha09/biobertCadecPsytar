went from Paxil directly to Cymbalta. I felt uncomfortable in my own body for weeks,but not enough to quit. It is a feeling difficult to describe, everyone is different, you will know it if you ever experience it. Over the course of time. I gained an additional 20lbs I am fatigued, have fluid retention, my pain has broken through again and my depression has come back. I am now on 90 mg My doctor suggested I try 120 mg I don't know what to do. To sum it up, Cymbalta is a good medicine to try if nothing else is helping and especially if you have fibro and depression.

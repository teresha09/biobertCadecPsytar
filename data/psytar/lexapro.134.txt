The first month is somewhat an experience, with varing degrees of dizziness, nausea, headaches and a feeling of not-being-right. Once the Med had firmly taken hold of me, my life turned from one full of anxiety, fear and depression, too one of absolute fulfillment and happiness. Six months on 20mg, decreasing to 10mg for 12 months. My final 3 months I was on 5mg, before whenning myself off completely. I experienced minor headaches, dizzienes and nausea for about 3 weeks period after my final 5mg. Today I am happy, NORMAL and loving life. Use the drug correctly and it does it's job!

nausea (at first), constipation, dizziness, NEVER sleep, always yawning and tired, very mean, hostile and aggressive when upset about something, very very bad night sweats. I have been on Cymbalta for about 2 months now and I feel like I am losing my mind. I went on it to calm me down a bit, I am very anxious, and it has done the opposite. While being on this medication I have no control over my emotions or my actions when I get emotional. I have never been a physical person and I do not think twice to hit someone if I am really hurt. I am pushing the people who I am closest to away. After I have an episode I feel like I was drunk and have NO IDEA why I did it! I need off!

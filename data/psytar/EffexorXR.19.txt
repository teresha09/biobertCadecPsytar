for the first few weeks it helped me feel better. then I began to have problems sleeping and started crying easily for no reason. I had a very hard time coming off the med. I was only on it for about 5 months. I wasn't hungry, but gained a lot of weight. I know I wasn't as active on the drug as off of it. I would never consider taking an antidepressant again. It was a horrible experience. I was never warned about possible side effects of it either.

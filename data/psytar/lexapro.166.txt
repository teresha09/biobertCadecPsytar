All side effects went away within 3 weeks. I started seroquel abilify and xanax at the same time so I'm not sure what side effects were just from the lexapro. It really helped my OCD. Without it I would still be counting every single footstep and rechecking EVERYTHING in my apartment. Really I only wash my hands like 100x a day now. It's great!

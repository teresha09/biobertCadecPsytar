vivid dreams, no sex drive, dry mouth, i get sick when i drink alcohol. I'm bipolar and was experiencing major depression despite my antibipolar meds (which luckily stopped the manic episodes). lexapro has caused NO mania and has really helped the depression-i no longer want to kill myself everyday. I kind of like having dreams-i never used to have them/remember them.

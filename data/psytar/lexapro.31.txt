vivid nightmares, sweats, higher anxiety levels, memory problems, concentration problems, teeth grinding and clenching of jaws. After 1 year of taking this drug, I stopped it cold turkey. I was taking 10 mg. After a lifetime of perfect dental checkups and having beautiful teeth, I now have 50 percent bone loss in my jaw because of the teeth grinding. It's signifigant to note that I had been wearing a night guard that was supposed to protect the teeth during this past year. I see my dentist for regular checkups and cleanings every 4 months, and I get x-rays every year. My dentist is aghast, Stress and/or anxiety and teeth grinding can cause bone loss. I was taking Ativan, Ambien, Atenolol and Lexapro for the anxiety and depression and have quit them all cold turkey. Withdrawal lasted about 2 weeks, but I feel tons better now. Not worth the side effects.

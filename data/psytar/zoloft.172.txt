sexual indifference, dizziness when I miss a dose. I have been taking 150 mg of Zoloft for a long time  (10 yrs). About 3 months ago,I began to have symptoms- not so much depression but of mood swings, severe irratibility & anger. I went to my doc & asked to try something new so we tried Cymbalta (made me manic), then Lexapro (made me completely emotionless). I have been on a downward spiral since going off zoloft, to the point that my doc has me on 2-3 mg of Xanax a day. Yesterday, I went in to my doc & said please, please dear God, put me back on Zoloft. If I thought it was bad before, I was SO SO wrong. Doc says that after being on Zoloft for so long, my brain may now have a chemical need for it. Not addiction, just an alteration. At least with Zoloft I can function and take care of my family.

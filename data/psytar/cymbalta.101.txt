Drastic drop in libido, profuse sweating, decreased appetite. I really don't know what to do. I was switched to Cymbalta from Pristiq for cost reasons because I have no insurance. I have MS and all my meds are very expensive, so my MD signed me up for an assistance plan and Cymbalta is on it. The decreased libido is a major problem because I truly love my husband of 14 years, but I have a VERY difficult time being interested on an intimate level. I also cannot deal with the sweating. I sweat so profusely that it has become embarrassing. I have taken Lexapro successfully in the past and I am thinking about trying that again, regardless of the cost.

Low sex drive and trouble ejaculating. Increased craving for alcohol. Overall feelling of "numb brain" as I call it, Trouble concentrating. Poor short term memory, Low motivation. I had spent approximately 15-16 years taking Prozac. I felt like it wasn't working well for me anymore so about 10 years ago, I was switched to Lexapro. Over the 10 years, it has done a great job at lowering my anxiety and evening me out. I worried less about things and was able to cope with issues and problems much better, Overall, I felt much better. But after 10 years of taking it, I feel like my brain has become dull and numb. It has become difficult to concentrate on anything or to get motivated to do anything. It has started to affect my job as there are days I just sit and stare at my computer and don't feel like doing anything and just can not think. I seem to be tired and unmotivated to do anything anymore. Even things at home that I used to find enjoyable before. Think maybe it is time for a change in meds.

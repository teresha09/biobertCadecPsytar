Insomnia, dizzy, anxiety, dry mouth, muscle aches, lack of concentraction, memory loss, whole body is numb. I have been on pazil for 7 yrs. Worked very well with minimal side effects but felt my anxiety was starting to get worse. I am tapering off pazil. Second week added 30 mg of cymbalta. Third week added 60 mg of cymbalta. Every one reacts different to medication but the side effects are so bad that I am going to call dr. To stop taking it. Good luck if u decide to take cymbalta.

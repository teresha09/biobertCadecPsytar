Started at 30 I was fine. After a month I was upped to 60 mg. A week later I started getting agitated easily, my hair is shedding way more than usual. I sweated like crazy, I felt even more depressed than ever , I became anti social and my anxiety worsened. I'm currently being weaned off this drug, while on Prozac. IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS TALK TO YOUR PSYCH ASAP DONT STOP TAKING THIS MEDICINE BY YOURSELF *** warning extreme consequences GOOGLE IT (cymbalta withdrawal) luckily I'm one of the good ones tho.

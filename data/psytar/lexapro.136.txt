Teeth Clenching, Insomnia at night and exhaustion durring the day. Reduced sex drive, 75% less ability to reach orgasm. I'm taking 10mg at night before I go to bed. I find that at night I have a harder time falling asleep and then durring the day im exhausted. I have the opposite of the "weight gain" problems as I seem to be losing weight now. I do have lethargy. where as I don't really want to do anything now durring the day. But overall im more stable. Much better then Zoloft which made me quite suicidal.

Vivid dreams, and remember them in such great detail ! Increased sex drive, reduced appetite,neck pain. I haven't been taking this drug too long and I am stopping because of the dryness it causes in my eyes (swollen) and my scalp (scratching). I can't read or focus my eyes because of the dryness and burning, my eyelids are swollen and, although it has helped somewhat with fibro pain, it's not worth it. Also, affects sleep patterns, I'm exhausted earlier, but can't sleep well. I've been on Zoloft for years, and we tried Cymbalta because my doctor felt I had gotten too used to Zoloft and it wasn't helping as much. When I first tried Cymbalta, I stopped after a week or two because I was so angry, I was biting off everyone's head. Stopped and started again and now experienced this dryness. I won't try it again.

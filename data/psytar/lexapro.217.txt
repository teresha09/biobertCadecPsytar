Sometimes prolongs ability to go to sleep. Lexapro has given me my life back. Suffered from sporadic depression/anxiety for over 20 years, and had been in and out of counseling for about 18 years before trying lexapro. I had previously taken prozac and valium and had horrible experiences with both, so was hesitant about trying medication again. Life had literally gotten unbearable, so about two years ago. I decided to try counseling once again coupled with medication. I found a terrific counselor who prescribed me lexapro after informing her of my previous experiences with prozac and valium. I am now able to live a normal life. I had to give it time to work and find the correct dosage for it to be effective. I initially took 10mgs for one week,no effect, 20mgs second week,no effect, then 30mgs. worked and continues to work like a charm!

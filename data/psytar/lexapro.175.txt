increased anxiety, sleeplessness, increased appetite, increased sensitivity, BUT only for first few weeks of upping dosage. I have been on all kinds of medications for 10+ years. I am also VERY sensitive to drugs and any side effects. I always have to start off on very low dosages. I had a very bad experience with Celexa so my Dr suggested Lexapro as it's better tolerated. I started off with 10mg which was ok but now that I'm on 20 I feel SO much BETTER, Yes, the first few weeks weren't easy, Honestly, reading any negative reviews on a medication won't help you either,been there, done that and it only makes you more aware of any bad reactions. I have to say so far, so good, well GREAT. It's 3 weeks going on 4 of the 20mg dosage and I actually feel "semi-normal" if that makes any sense. I feel hopeful and positive on a more daily basis. My depression is at an all-time low and my anxiety getting better. I have relied on Xanax to calm my panic attacks and now slowly weaning off of it due to the Lexapro! I sure hope this lasts. it's feels so good to finally feel like life is worth living!

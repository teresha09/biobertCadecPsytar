Mild itching and headaches. I've refused antidepressants throughout my entire 4yr extremely physically and emotionally abusive marriage, but after also losing a pregnancy a few months ago, I needed help. This medicine has saved my life. I have finally left my marriage, regained my confidence and will to live. I see hope for my future, am more social than ever and feel happy for the first time in years. With a strict exercise regimen, I have also managed to lose weight on my already small frame. I was always anti drugs. but hope people will read this and give this med a shot. It is a godsend for me.

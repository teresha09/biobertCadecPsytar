first day or two- felt "out of it", extreme fatigue, Currently (3 wks), I am having bruising, hair loss, fatigue, can't sleep through the night, increased anxiety when I wake, jaw clenching, and difficulty having orgasm. I really didn't think that I was depressed, but I think since taking the Lexapro, my mood has lifted. I seem to have a more positive outlook. My anxiety improved slightly for a week, but this week seems to be worse than ever. I'm going to continue taking it in hopes that I will see improvement over the next 3 to 4 weeks. Years ago I was treated for depression and took Prozac. It saved my life! Since anxiety was the main issue this time, I didn't push for the Prozac. I'm not really thrilled with the Lexapro, but I will keep you posted.

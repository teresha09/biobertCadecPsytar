Horrible insomnia, shakes, the "brain shivers" many talk about, and I couldn't sit still. I lost over 50 lbs in the last 6 months just from lack of eating or throwing up what I did eat. The doctor knew I was on Steroid inhalers and a smoker when not pregnant, but did nothing when my blood pressure skyrocketed but double my dose. I had to stop working because I work in Tech/IT and I couldn't stare at a computer screen or focus my eyes without becoming violently nauseous, Horrible vertigo . I felt like I was always in a bad hash high and scarily disconnected from my body. I started S/I again for the first time in years while on Effexor. It all finally came to a hilt after not taking 2 doses under doctors orders New Years Eve because I knew I would be drinking. Full blown hallucinations . slipped into a dissociative episode and called the cops on my husband thinking he was a boyfriend who died almost 10 years ago and trying to kill me. When I told the doctor about the episode,. The doctor put me on Effexor after miscarrying in my 5th month of pregnancy, but did not prescribe any kind of Grief Therapy.

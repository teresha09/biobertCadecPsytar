Apathy, memory loss, blurred vision, insomnia, nightmares, sexul dysfunction, shivers and shakes and the list goes on. Chronic Discontinuation Syndrome. I was told to taper from 75mg to 37mg for 1 week and then 37mg to 0 for the next week. I had prior knowledge to know that this was way to fast so I took 6 weeks to taper and still suffered terribly, it was worse than my original condition and symptoms, be very careful stopping this drug too quickly or it can be PURE HELL! The worst AD withdrawals I have ever experienced and I've tried heaps. In my opinion just don't go there, it's not worth it.

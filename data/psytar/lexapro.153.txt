Nausea (severe at times), occasional tremors, delayed orgasm, hot flashes. The first time I took Lexy (10 mg) was terrifying. I went to sleep, then woke up a couple hours later feeling extremely nauseous. All of the sudden a hot flash shot throughout my body, my heart skipped several beats, and I felt like I was going to die for a minute. I gradually calmed down and sweated profusely, That said, Lexy ain't all bad. I've been more socially confident, been told for the first time that I'm outgoing, and haven't had as much anxiety. My emotional range might be a little muted (I don't cry nearly as much), but I still feel like myself. Increased dosage to 15 mg a month ago. I missed a dose yesterday, and now I'm nauseous, my abdomen is queasy, and I get occasional, incredibly uncomfortable waves of heat that shoot up from my stomach to my sternum. Although I took my missed dose this afternoon, the symptoms are lingering, Rather disturbing, and I wonder how the hell I'm going to get off this stuff, But Lexy's different for everyone, and it certainly has helped out with my anxiety. Keep an open mind.

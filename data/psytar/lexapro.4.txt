Plenty! First 10 days were HORRIBLE, like a looong panic attack with anxiety/nausea. It calmed down when I got some Xanor for three weeks (was still worse than before lexapro though), after that back to lots of anxiety, derealisation, nausea etc, Also couldn't sleep much, woke at 6.30am with horrible anxiety no matter when I fell asleep the day before. It didn't help me out, at all. My anxiety is worse than before, and I've been getting more and more dizzy by the week . the last three weeks I haven't been able to watch TV since it makes me feel nauseus, and I haven't been outside in two weeks due to the dizziness! The last week or two I've been feeling nausea all day, mostly due to the dizziness, Everyone's different though, and you should probably give it a try, others are having luck. I'm tapering it off now, though.

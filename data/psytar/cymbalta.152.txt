When taking at night, Cymbalta caused insomnia something awful. I would have heart palpitations and awake 3-4X a night. My doctor switched my dosage time to morning and I noticed a world of change. My only symptom now is sweating (clammy feeling). My mood is a serious one with some laughter. I wonder if anyone has figured out how to find the return of the "fun and "carefree" side of themselves? Great drug! Initially I felt as if I was "awakened." This seemed to subside. Don't know if I am used to it or it is no longer effective?

weight gain mostly and i think my dose is too high, when i was first put on it it was just 75mg and i have gradually increased it to 300mg sometimes - now i think this high dose has caused me to have an excessive appetitte. i am worried about trying to cut down gradually as i read so much scary stuff about going off it

Brief headache, increased sweating at night. Effexor has been fine in that it helped me function, but I've never actually felt like myself. No real bad side effects unless I missed a dose then I'd cry a lot. Still, it worked better than Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil. However, I'm now on 300mg and it's not working at all any more, and I'm really afraid of withdrawal. My doctor is immediately switching me from Effexor to Cymbalta because he says it's easier to withdraw from the latter. I've heard horror stories out there about that one too. Is there no drug that will help us?

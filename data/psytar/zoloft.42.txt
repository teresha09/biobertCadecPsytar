Weight gain, tiredness, completely killed sex drive. Mild withdrawal symptoms are dizziness, irritability, and upset stomach. The medication helped somewhat. I taped up to 100mg/day over a several week period. I was definitely more relaxed about things and Zoloft created an overall sense of well being. Even though I gained weight and had no sex drive I didn't much care about it. I was sleeping at least 9 hours a day and still felt tired upon waking, yawned throughout much of the day, However, over time I felt it was becoming less and less effective. The side effects were tough to take and it no longer seemed like a good tradeoff. Now tapering down over several weeks. I am experiencing some of the side effects mentioned elsewhere, dizziness, irritability, upset stomach, although they are fairly mild.

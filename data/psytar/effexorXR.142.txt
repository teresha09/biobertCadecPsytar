At 37.5mg my depression is controlled. I will experience episodes of depression but it's manageable. When I increase the dose to 75mg I experience vivid dreams, interrupted sleep, anxiety, irritability and unwarranted anger. For me, this medication manages my depression if I take it at a low dose. I have not gained/lost weight, but I am an endurance athlete.

didn't notice much difference until 75 mg- where i completely freaked out. i thought about suicide and was VERY scared to continue any other sort of SSRI. -later they found out i was bipolar so this could be the reason for the adverse reactions. this drug works well for my dad with unipolar major depression. -it didn't work for me, but i am bipolar. can be  dangerous to those who are manic depressive.

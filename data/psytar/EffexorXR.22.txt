Weight gain, insomnia, heart pains, dizziness, suicidalness, zero sex drive, numbness. Worst drug i've ever had the misfortune to have prescribed to me. Have been on it for over 6 years now, and have been trying to come off it for the last 6 months, and even with cutting back very gradually on the dose for months, it has caused dreadful side effects, feeling dizzy and like i am going to vomit all the time, feel spaced out, feel absolutely dreadful. Have had absolutely no sex drive whatsoever, am completely dead from the waist down, feel like it has ruined my sex drive for life, as even now i have not had it for 5 days, i still feel nothing whatsoever. This is the worst drug ever, i'm sure i'd be better off if I'd taken cocaine or something, as it has completely ruined my life and made it worse than ever. Avoid at all costs, even if your quack might want to ruin your life with it.

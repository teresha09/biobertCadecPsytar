love Cymbalta. No negative sexual side effects, no brain zaps - but I consistently take it. Definately not weight gain. not sure on a decrease. Yes - you may have difficulty sleeping, I take Trazadone but have for years. I did a rapid decline on my cymbalta because I lost my insurance. I was on 60s and did a few days of 30's and quite. I didn't have bad withdrawal. I didn't think but about a week later I started having severe pain on my right back side. A few days later I was in the hospital with bilateral pulmonary emboli. I am a low risk person (no smoking, low weight, am on birth control) but I definately believe that my PEs were a result of the rapid decline in Cymbalta. I did have a body rash (Malasezia) and other symptoms of my body experiencing a pH or general shift. I also had a pleural effusion and was hospitalized for over a day. It was very very difficult to get my pain under control - they had me maxed out on narcotics. It was determined that the withdrawal of Cymbalta was giving me additional muscle spasms/tinges and I went back on 30 mg of Cymbalta to help with my level 12 pain - and it worked. Weird but true.

I must say that this medication helped with depression. Right after i started it my crying spells stopped and suicidal thoughts were gone. In the beginning I felt rather numb not happier. I have goten much calmer and was able to to face day to day problems without huge anxiety and stress, So overall . it probably saved me. Side effects included: First month or so: going back and forth from being quite and calm to being extremaly anxious without a reason especially about two hours after taking the doze, Very vivid, weird dreams, occasional nightmares every night for about 2 months. Dialated pupils after a few weeks of taking, to the point of blurred vision. Gone after 2 weeks. Incredible sweet tooth . couldn't stop myself from eating sweets. Just eat cereal and fruit if you don't want to gain weight. This has subsided after a month or so, Constipation . didn't go away. I eat youghurts and this helps a little. The worst side effect that I still expirience are: Libido is nonexistan. I started with 5mg a day and worked up to 10mg a day after a couple of weeks.

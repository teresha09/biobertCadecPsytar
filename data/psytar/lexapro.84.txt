Alcohol-related blackouts, super-intense dreams, sleepy, nervous. Worked really well first six months or so for my depression but after several freaky alcohol incidents where I drank 3-4 glasses of wine and then blacked out completely, I cut down my dosage from 20 to 10 mg and plan to go back on Welbutrin at my next doctor's consult. I have never had more interesting dreams than those I had on Lexipro . I'll miss those: very detailed, vivid, fascinating, cinematic-like dreams, Amazing, But, my friends complained that I acted completely out of character when I drank, and I don't remember anything I said or did, so I've decided this isn't right for me.

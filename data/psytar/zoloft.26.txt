NONE, This anti-depressant did absolutely nothing for me. I mean, literally, nothing. No side effects, no results. I was severly depressed and breast-feeding my son so this was the only option I had at the time (it is considered safe for nursing babies). I struggled with the decision to take it because I was so worried that it may harm him because it does pass into breast milk in tiny amounts. Then I condidered not breastfeeding and taking an antidepressant. After much thought, I decided that the benefits of nursing outweighed the negligable risks of the meds,  And, to not treat the depression would have been plain stupid. I was VERY depressed,  Also, I was working full-time and pumping milk at work so that he could be exclusively fed breast milk for 4 months,  Well, I may as well have not taken anything as it did not help at all. Now I take Cymbalta and that helps a lot more (I am no longer nursing, my son is 16 months). It's just weird how certain meds work for some people and not others.

any I had initially went away after a few weeks but the lack of sex drive is why I had to quit taking it. Some mental fogginess in school. I have taken many drugs but Zoloft was the best for me. No weight issues, energy was good, sleep was amazing. Success with these meds truly depends on staying in touch with your physician so they can adjust or change as necessary. This drug works fast and worked great for me! I have been on Prozac (loved it but I got migranes), Effexor, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, and mood stabilizers Depakote and Lamictal. Today I start Celexa since it has less sexual side effects. If I was single, my only choice would be the best for me, Zoloft.

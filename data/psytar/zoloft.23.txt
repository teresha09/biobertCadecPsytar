Severe teeth clenching/TMJ which caused excruciating headaches . clenching came on right after taking the dose and would gradually wear off . took me three days to figure out the connection, during which I was laying in a darkened room with a migraine. Do NOT take this drug if you have a history of migraines or TMJ . this was the worst three days of my life till I figured out the connection from Googleing it . the manufacturer doesn't say anything about this but there are thousands of hits on the topic.

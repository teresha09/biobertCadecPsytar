Dry mouth, nausea,no sex drive, and RLS worsened. I was put on Zoloft for severe depression. It has worked for my depression but the Dr. told me that it would help my RLS. It made my RLS 4xs worse. Also my sex drive went from brooooom brooom to put put if any. In the first couple of weeks I had SEVERE drymouth and hated that. But it works great for my depression

CONSTANT HEADACHE, HAIR LOSS, & EXTREME WEIGHT GAIN. EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO, MY SON SUDDENLY DIED AT AGE 32)  FOUR YEARS LATER, I COULD NOT DEAL WITH IT ANYMORE. I TRIED SUICIDE, BUT WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK, I FELL COMPLETELY APART. I WAS PUT IN THE HOSPITAL, & AFTER THE DOCTORS CHECKED EVERYTHING THEY KNEW, A PSYCHIATRIST WAS CALLED IN & AFTER ONLY 2 VISITS, HE PUT ME ON CLONAZEPAM, NEURONTIN, & ZOLOFT. I HAVE TAKEN THESE MEDS FOR ABOUT 13 YEARS UNTIL I STARTED HAVING LEG ACHES AT NIGHT. ABOUT 7 MONTHS AGO, MY REGULAR DOCTOR CHANGED OUT THE ZOLOFT FOR CYMBALTA. IT IMMEDIATELY TOOK CARE OF THE LEG PROBLEMS & I SLEPT VERY WELL. THEN, I STARTED NOTICING THINGS HAPPENING ALL AT ONCE. MY HAIR WAS SHEDDING AT AN UNUSUAL RATE, I WAS HAVING A DULL HEADACHE CONSTANTLY. LIKE 24/7, & I HAVE PUT ON AT LEAST 30 LBS IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS, ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT CHANGED MY EATING HABITS. I DID NOT EVEN SUSPECT THAT IT WAS ONE OF MY MEDS UNTIL MY DAUGHTER, WHO IS A REGISTERED NURSE, SUGGESTED THAT I LOOK UP ALL OF THEM & SEE WHAT THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE. WHEN I GOT TO CYMBALTA. THERE THEY WERE. ALL OF MY PROBLEMS WERE RIGHT HERE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER COMMENTS. I SEE MY DOCTOR SOON FOR MY USUAL CHECK-UP & I WANT TO GO BACK TO ZOLOFT, BUT THE WAY SOME OF YOU DESCRIBE WITHDRAWAL, I'M REALLY SCARED. I DON'T EVER WANT TO FEEL LIKE I DID BEFORE I STARTED ON THE MEDS. PLEASE SEND ME YOUR SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHAT YOU THINK I SHOULD DO.

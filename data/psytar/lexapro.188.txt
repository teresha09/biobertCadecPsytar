Sweating at night. Initial weight gain, but have since lost it. Other than an initial difficulty reaching orgasm I've had no problems achieving orgasm after the first 4-6 weeks of being on Lexapro. I feel so much better emotionally and physically than I did when I was on Celexa. I've gotten back to exercising and enjoying my life in ways that I haven't been able to for years, Thank you!

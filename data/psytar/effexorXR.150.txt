Reduced libido, some difficulty with ejaculation. Some anxiety and "brain shocks" for the first day or two. My depression mostly manifested in an inability to start new projects, rather than any feelings of sadness. Right after I started Effexor XR, I noticed a big improvement in this for a couple of weeks; since then, there's some improvement, but it's not as pronounced. I may switch to another medication (or raise my dose) if the effect continues to decline. I'm taking 75mg/day.

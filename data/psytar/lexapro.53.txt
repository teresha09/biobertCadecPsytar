jaw clenching at night, teeth grinding, nausea, constipation, food cravings, weight gain, total loss of sex drive, inability to O, insomnia, loss of taste. I will be asking my doctor to try something else on my next appointment. My DH says he can tell my moods are better, but I am making an extreme effort to be more pleasant around my family (I didn't realize how horrible I was before). I do not feel any better, I still have anxiety, severe foul moods, complete negative outlook on life. I can not see that this drug has helped much and I am not willing to continue given the side effects I am experiencing. I've always had somewhat of a sweet tooth, but now I crave peanut butter cups with a vengance- it is the only thing that still tastes good to me, But, I am also eating like crazy. If I let myself get hungry, then I get nauseated. I have gained 10 lbs in 1 month, and am terrified it will continue.

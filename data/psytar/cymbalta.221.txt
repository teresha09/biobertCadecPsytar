First Month: Insomnia, Constipation, Nausea, Exhaustion, Severe Withdrawal with missed dose. Side effects have relented a bit into the second month. This drug is horrible at first, but you HAVE to stick with it. I know it's hard. You CANNOT miss a dose or you will be sicker than you've ever been in withdrawal. I can't even begin to describe how awful it is. Constipation was really bad in first month, now it comes and goes. I've increased my fiber through my diet -lots of fresh fruit and veggies, that seems to help. Nausea is pretty much gone, and my sleep pattern seems to be normalizing now. For the first few weeks I was on it I had intense dreams, some of them unpleasant. If I was able to finally get to sleep, the sleep was not good. That has also subsided. This drug has saved my life. After 2 months I am feeling mentally normal again. I am slowly getting my life back from severe depression. This is a hard drug to stick with, I was REALLY sick at first. It really does get better. Just DON'T miss a dose. 24 hours after missing a dose the withdrawal is really intense and you are really sick until about 3 hours after you take a dose. I've suffered with PMDD for years, and I always know when I am about to start when the PMDD starts up. I can get so depressed right before my period that I would be downright suicidal, cry uncontrollably, have passive aggressive tendencies, and that is gone. This month I did not even know I was about to start! I don't know how I will ever get off this drug when the time comes, because of the withdrawals. For now it has drastically changed my life for the better, so I will just have to cross that bridge when I get there.

Today was my 3rd dose of Zolft (50mg). First 2 days had loose stools. This morning my jaw felt tight and then I suddenly was hit with an overwhelming feeling of panic. My heart was racing, skin tingling, and even oddly numb. Basically felt very very strange. As I'm a nurse I was convinced I was having an allergic reaction and was terrified I was going to pass out. Pulled myself together and spoke to GP & psych who feel it's anxiety and side-effects but even with my worst anxiety I have never felt quite like that. Am determined to persevere but fearful of experiencing the same thing tomorrow. Am reassured by reading other people's comments but would like to know if anyhone else felt anything similar in first few days. Have trouble rating Zoloft as I have not been on it long enough to really know yet.

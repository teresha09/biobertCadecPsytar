EXTREME lower leg & foot swelling, EXTREMELY itchy red rash lower extremities, profuse sweating, zombie state - extreme sleepiness shortly after taking and without any warning, lower extremity cramping, mouth sores, extreme weight gain, NO libedo what so ever, very bad memory. For the past 9 months I have been on Prednisone to keep the swelling and itching at bay. After seeing every type of doctor AND having every type of blood test/urine test/a fat biopsy about the swelling and itching rash on the inside of my knees and what started on the inside of my ankles. I have FINALLY figured out that I am having an extreme allergic reaction to Cymbalta. It also landed me into the ER as my upper lip swelled up after a nap one day. I was then put on Prednisone 20 mg a day to subdue the swelling and rash/itching. After putting on even a lot more weight because of the combination of the Cymbalta AND Prednisone, I have plans for stomach surgery within the next 2 months. I started investigating/researching Cymbalta and I noticed a common denominator. EVERY site I went to mentioned as a "Severe reaction to Cymbalta" ALL of my symptoms. I had an appt today with my doctor that prescribed the Cymbalta and I tried multiple times to advise him of all of the websites I checked, EVEN THE FDA. GOV, they all said the same symptoms. HE ACTUALLY TOLD ME THAT I WAS NOT ALLERGIC TO THE ACTUAL MEDICINE, IT WAS THE DYE IN THE CAPSULES I WAS ALLERGIC TO! After going through the entire endocrine system, ie: do you have diabetes, etc He decided to change me back to Pristiq. i quit taking the Cymbalta 3 days ago and I was able to titer myself off the Prednisone and my rash,itching and swelling is so much worse than ever!

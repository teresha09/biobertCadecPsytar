started 2 years ago for depression, panic attacks and social anxiety. The first week was hell. I felt like I was on speed, but after my body adjusted it gave me my life back. I stopped over analyzing everything. I was able to go out without thinking everyone was looking at me, and I was able to get out of bed willingly every day. I truly felt "normal". After 2 years. I decided that I would like to give life without meds a try, BIG MISTAKE! I weaned slowly from 150mg to 75 to 37.5 and off. I feel nauseous alot and my depression and social anxiety has returned almost 100%. I'm thinking seriously about going back on, but after reading some of your comments, I'm a bit scared. I'll talk to my Dr. and try to do some research. Has anyone gone off Effexor and then gone back on?

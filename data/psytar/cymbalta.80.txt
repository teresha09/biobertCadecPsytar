Fatigue, extreme changes in body temperature (hot to cold), slight headache, insomnia, agitation and anxiousness, fidgeting, food tasting odd and loss of concentration. The side effects are worse than the benefits. I decided to stop taking the drug as I made me feel worse than I did before I took it. I was not prepared to endure the side effects for 2-4 weeks to see whether the drug would work or not. I can't see how it can be an anti-depressant when some of the side effects are depressive thoughts and actions.

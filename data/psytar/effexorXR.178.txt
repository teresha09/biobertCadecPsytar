Going on it the side effects only lasted about a week. I had 2 nights where I just couldn't sleep, was slightly nautious and my pupils were MASSIVE! But all in all it wasn't too bad. I was worried about coming off it so I timed it so I had a week booked off work for it. The main side effect was being light headed, like a permanent head rush, Again. it was bearable. If anyone has any reservations. I would say try it. For me it was fantastic. It helped me get through a tough stage in my life. I'm off it about a month now and have come out the other side smiling!

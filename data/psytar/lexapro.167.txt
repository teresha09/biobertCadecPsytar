Dry mouth, weight gain, slightly moody, irritable. I began taking Lexapro after giving birth to a premature baby. I was in therapy as well, but the post partum floored me! I began taking 10mg and then gradually brought it up to 20 mg last year. What a difference! I recommend Lexapro very highly. I've taken Prozac in the past, but the side effects were too much to handle. My mind is now clear, my thoughts are in check, and I no longer have post partum. I continue to take it because I was diagnosed with clinical depression 9 years ago and I don't plan on stopping. If I have to take it for the rest of my life, then I will.

been great for depression. I know that I cannot quit "cold turkey" as withdrawals are severe. It is a trade off that I am satisfied with 3 years. No longer on an emotional rollercoaster. When I wake up sad, I don't spiral into a full blown depression. If I get depressed now, it is a legitimate reason. ie death of a friend or loved one. I will continue on Cymbalta. No sexual side effects!

Sleepiness. all the time, yet will have trouble falling asleep at night, can nap for half a day no problem. Jaw clenching at night and during the day, Nausea, Stomache pain, loose bowel movements, followed by constipation, Feeling dehydrated, and dry mouth, Headaches, blurred vision, increased episodes of vertigo. Some initial weight gain, but has now setteled down and am experiencing the reverse. Episodes of ravenous hunger and loss of appetite. Indifference to food. Difficulty achieving orgasm, less intense orgasm. Despite the many side effects I love this drug. I am taking 30mg, started on 10mg, a month late went to 20, a month later went to 30mg. I now feel so much calmer and happier, no anxiety attacks or feelings of dread. Did gain some weight but after being on the drug for 9 months that seems to have settled down. I had increased appetite which may account for that. My appetite has lowered significantly since being on higher dose. The fatigue and sleepiness is a pain, but am willing to put up with it as it beats not being able to get out of bed.

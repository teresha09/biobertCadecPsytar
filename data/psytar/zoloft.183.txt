Its really to early to tell for me. I had been taking Lexapro for about 5 years and it did little to help my anxiety. My doctor just prescribed zoloft this week so I only have been on it two days. I have noticed i have the jitters and seem unable to concentrate fully. I will give it time. Please email me as long as you have something good to say. I am somewhat fragile at this moment.

Severe insomnia first week, almost constant nausea, migraines, intense panic first couple nights. all subsided within a week. Lexapro has helped me immensely. I'm no longer worrying about the next time I'm going to get depressed or have a panic attack. I feel like I finally know what it's like to be normal, and I'm so happy. I really feel like I've taken control of my life again. I resisted taking this medicine at first, but decided it was for the best when my depression and anxiety started getting in the way of my functioning normally. I still don't like being on medicine, but I can't deny how much it has helped me.

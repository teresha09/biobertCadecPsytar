Difficulty Urinating; Very Tired and Listless All Day After Taking Dose; Nausea; No Taste For Food; General Apathy. I was on this pill at 30mg a day for 7 days before the Dr. told me to take 60mg a day. I could hardly eat, and just sat on the couch everyday staring at the tv. It made my anxiety worse and I was quicker to anger than usual. I found that I just did not care about anyone or anything anymore. I would not reccommend this drug to anyone with anxiety issues, as it was not a very big help.

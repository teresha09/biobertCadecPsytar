spaced out, difficulty sleeping, headaches(shocks), night sweats. For the first two weeks I felt very spacey and drugged, a feeling similar to taking extasy. But after my body adjusted, I did notice quite a difference in my anxiety, and length of dressions bouts. I have suffered from anxiety (anxiety attacks), bouts of depression, sadness and anger since I was a young teen. I am almost 30 and have tried several other medications which had much worse side effects and no positive effects, such as: paxil and celexa. The only current side effect I have is the night sweats and I do get "headshocks" as I call them, if I forget to take my pill on time.

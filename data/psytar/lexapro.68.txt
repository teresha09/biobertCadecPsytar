Started at 10 pmg, Felt better within a week. Stayed on 10 for 9 mos then went up to 20mg. brain fog memory loss. finally attributing to lexapro, atleast at this dosage/ Very apathetic and have gained 20lbs easily. muscle and joint pain. dunno if that is related to lexapro. Helpful with anxiety. I did not experience sex drive problem. but i am going down to 10mg again. then maybe off. Have tried a majority of these HAPPY pills, none work great and def have side effects, What now? Duno but i need my brain back! lol

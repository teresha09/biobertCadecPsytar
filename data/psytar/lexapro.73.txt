i have not started taking this yet. I was just taken off EffexorXR after 2weeks because i had an allergic reaction to it. Which sucks because it was working really good. Now my Dr. Wants me to try Lexapro. I cant figure out if i should take it at night or in the morning? And Im really tempted not to take it at all . probably not a good idea? I appriciate all this info.

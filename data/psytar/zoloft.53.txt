Headache, dry mouth, dizziness, chronic fatigue, increased appetite, stiffed jaw, decreased libido, weight gain, brain fog. Zoloft did help with my anxiety but the side effects were just to much to handle to the point that I would rather live with anxiety than to live with these ugly side effects. the doctor started me at 25mg up to 75mg in two months. The side effects got stronger and stronger as I felt brain fog, chronic fatigue and all those other side effects I mentioned on a daily basis. I would also wake up in the mornings drained out feeling dizzy, making it real hard for me to get ready and go to work. I also gained like 7lb while on zoloft. I believe if i took this drug any longer I would most likely gain 30+lbs real fast. No thank you. Never will i take this crap again.

Jaw Clenching, Headache-seems to be fading, Worse Brain Fog than fibromyalgia alone, More Extreme Fatigue, loss of appetite control, seems no help with fibro pain, dry mouth, heart palpitations, urine retention?, edema. I had to stop taking citalopram because highest dose stopped working for MDD, panic, and anxiety. This means fibromyalgia pain is back with a vengeance, However, I no longer am suicidal and this got rid of a 4-day-long panic attack within 1 day of commencing. I deal with massive exhaustion from FMS, pmdd, shingles, and EDS, and this has made it worse, though I'm making it through work. Hoping that fades or it's time for stimulant! Also, hugely improved productivity; I'm unfrozen, However, this is countered by a waning desire to spend quality time with quality people, but I'm forcing myself beyond that because friends are priceless. A little concerned that loss of control with appetite will cause weight gain that will depress me, Also, brain fog may be clearing a bit.

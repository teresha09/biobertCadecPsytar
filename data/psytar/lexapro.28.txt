Racing heart, severe anxiety, panic, nausea, speeded-up metabolism. It was brilliant for 2 weeks, except for some queasiness. But into the 3rd week I began to wake in the night with very scary heart palpitations. After a few nights of this (while feeling good during the day), the palpitations and subsequent panic were still there in the morning and continued throughout the day. I stopped taking it 3 days ago . in addition to stopping caffeine on doctor's orders . and I still have occasional heart flutters, a clenched stomach, and the anxiety that goes with that. I also think Lexapro and alcohol were a bad mix for me. I'd rather be depressed.

trouble sleeping-still depressed. This drug didn't help at all. I kept telling my doc that I wasn't feeling a difference but she just kept prescibing it. She always had plenty of samples to give out. I felt like she was "bought" by the drug reps that kept giving her the samples and she was prescibing it for her benefit not mine. The withdrawals were not pretty. Would never ever ever take this again and I found a new doc, Don't be afraid to test the system and tell your doc no, that things aren't working and they aren't listening.

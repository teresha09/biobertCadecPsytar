weight gain, hairloss, hallucinations, back pain, muscle spasms, numbness in hands. The drug has made a difference in my life. I have people who work for me that have seen a change and don't know I am taking an anti-depressant. I only take 50mg and life is a lot nicer. I am more tolerating and less judgemental. But the side effects I am experiencing are bothersome. I was suprised to read through the comments and no one elses experienced hairloss.

In the beginning, extreme nausea, digestive upsets. got better but never went away completely. Horrid hot flashes and sweating at night. I have tried almost every antidepressant and this is BY FAR the worst. My mood improved but I became "flat" and became a recluse. My legs became restless and felt tight however the drugs worked well for pain for the most past. Going off this drug was horrible. I took prozac instead of the cymbalta and that helped alot. The nausea resumed however for nearly a week. The medicine is very pricy and prozac is $5 generic. I had been on prozac 15 years with mild side effects. I will stick with that. Check out the other options before you chose cymbalta.

Cymbalta only work for short period of time (months). After nearly a year, I started to feel very very weak and easily tired. My doctor and I decided to stop taking it. The withdrawal side effects especially brain flashes or brain zap was VERY PAINFUL even though I tapered off the medication . I would NOT recommend taking this medication. The withdrawal side effects is worse than the starting side effects. I felt like a drug addict that could not function without the medication.

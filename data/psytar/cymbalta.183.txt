On 60 mg, took away depression, took away anger 'Lizzie Borden' complex. On 120 mg 11 months later, depression has lifted and general anxiety has decreased overall, but I feel like I am always 'shaking' and 'cannot breathe', and I cannot sleep any longer than 3 hours per night. I have been taking Cymbalta (60 mg once a day) since late December 2007)  I was amazed at how quickly it began to lift my mood. It also greatly lessened what I have heard called the 'Lizzy Borden' complex ( extreme anger and outbursts). I am bi-polar, and have also taken Lamictal 100 mg once per day on and off in the past. In the past two weeks however, my mood really dropped, and I was feeling suicidal. The doctor then put me back on Lamictal and told me to stay on it, and raised my Cymbalta level to 120 mg I started taking the higher dose this past Monday (11-3-08). Today is Sunday, 11-9-08)  In the past three nights, I have been experiencing insomnia. I am really, really shaky, nervous, a bit tense and I feel like I am having heart palpitations. The other night I had a very strange dream that my husband was married to my mother and he was 'dating' me, although he wasn't supposed to. I was also pregnant in the dream! Kind of freaked me out.

dry mouth, anorgasmic At first, strange dreams, meaning very vivid and colorful. However, now, they don't occur. Also, it used to regulate my sleep cycle to something more normal (like getting tired around 11 or 12). Also, my appetite used to be more "normal" when I started, but now is back to more random eating/snacking. I feel ambivalent about it every so often. There are reports about how people get addicted to it and feel "brain zaps" when trying to go off. As Effexor is my third anti-depressant, it's worked the best and I'm sick of shopping around. Even with the side effects, which aren't too bad and more just annoying, I can deal. However, I worry about the day when I decide to go off of them and determine if my depression is more chronic or clinical. I've gone a few days before without taking it and felt dizzy, tired, nauseous, and spacey. I'm afraid that the mild addiction will be enough to keep me on them forever, even if I show signs of recovery. Also, if I'm on them forever, that could be bad news if I decide to have kids (in the way future). good news: there's a generic coming out, meaning it doesn't cost $10 a pill (before insurance) sometime soon

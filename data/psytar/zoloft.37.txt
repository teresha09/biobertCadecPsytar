have never cut myself before I started taking Zoloft. A week after the commencement of my treatment I took a razor blade and cut my wrists. This medication has made me more suicidal than I used to be. It was the time of my exams at university, and unfortunately I was unable to think and concentrate on anything and therefore failed.

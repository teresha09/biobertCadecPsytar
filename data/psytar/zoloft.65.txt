The first time I took Zoloft was for depression and explosive anger when I was 19 and it worked like a dream. Now im 28 and it gave me restless leg syndrome, paranoia, anxiety and I craved sweets constantly. On the plus side my memory did improve alot ( im ADD) Now im on Lexapro lets see how this goes.

Horrible headaches, brain "swishes" or "zapping" when I was even a few hours late for a dose, constipation, horrible crying spells when going through withdrawal. Wanted to kill myself several times while on this drug, when I hadn't been suicidal before. This drug should really be banned by the FDA. HOW TO QUIT THIS DRUG:  Buy an over-the-counter sinus headache medicine for the zaps, and take very high doses of Omega-3s, Also, attempt to take a low dose of a drug such as Zoloft if you are able. Going off the drug sucks, but these things made it a lot better.

Yawning every minute or two. Quit counting yesterday at 100 by lunch time. Diarrhea for two weeks. Have felt no effects at 25mg/day week one and 50mg/day week two. Side effects so far outweigh the lack of benefits. I have averaged 6 hours of sleep per night for years. The last 4 days I have sleep 8-10 hours and then wanted to lay in bed another 4)  I can't take the side effects and go to work. I have never taken meds of this type before and wonder if it worth the trouble to try and tough it out until the effects to kick in.

Horrible insomnia, highly depressive and suicidal feelings, inability to orgasm, loss of energy, exhaustion. I took this medicine for about a month, and during that month I did not sleep more than 5 hours a night. I woke up at least 5 or 6 times every night. It was horrible. I felt weak and exhausted and unable to keep up with normal days. I took so many short naps, but nothing helped. My feelings of depression, which Cymbalta was supossed to fix, were increased and I found myself contemplating sucidial or destructive actions a lot. I talked to my doctor and he IMMEDIABTLY suggested I come off of it. Another thing that bothered me, well a lot, was I was unable to orgasm. at all. I have since changed medicines and am able to once again, so I totally blame that effect on the drug. Overall, the drug gave me a bad feeling. I would not suggest this to anyone else, especially if you are switching from another medication.

Diarrhea, inability to orgasm, loss of sexual pleasure, significant weight gain, withdrawal was not pleasant. I would say that the drug did remove the initial anxiety and depression I was feeling. It did not help improve my memory nor do anything for my social anxiety though. The first 6 weeks there was a lot of running to the bathroom . I don't see how someone like a truck driver could ever take this drug. As time went on, my sexual sensitivity began to diminish, my weight began to skyrocket (20+ lbs) and the benefits of the drug began to be outweighed by the anxiety and depression caused by getting fat and sexual dysfunction . so I quit and decided to take a cognitive approach (listening to self-help tapes with positive messaging) and exercise. It's been a few months without and I'm OK . but withdrawal is a *bitch*. To me it feels like you are feverish and it lasted maybe 5-6 weeks, Let's not be too dramatic here . I didn't feel like it was the end of the world, but it was no walk in the park. I did half my dose for 2 weeks before quitting, though. Despite all this, looking back, it might have been what I needed for the time that I was on it.

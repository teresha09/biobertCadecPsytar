The side effects were insomnia, night sweats, dizziness, headaches, palpitations and lower right abdominal pain. I am now trying to cut back and on top of all those symptoms I am very itchy, shaky and miserable. I was prescribed 75 mg three in the morning and three at night for a total of 450 mg. Recently found out that is above the FDA recommended dosage. No wonder I suffered so many side effects. Have not slept the whole time I have been on the medication. I am trying to cut the dosage down so I can get off the medication. Make sure you are not prescibed more then you should be taking. I am suffering and should of not trusted the NP who prescribed the pills without first checking it out.

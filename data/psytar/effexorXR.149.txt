Brain zaps, excessive yawning, fatigue, increased appetite, vivid sexual dreams, sexual side effects. I am currently takin Effexor XR 37.5mg, sometimes twice a day. When I first started I loved it! It really gave me my life back somewhat, Now I feel I am extremely drowsy at times, hard to stay awake. I will also get the brain zaps, electrical shocks if I'm just lying in bed. scary. But I will continue to take it for now and see what happens!

only had side effects in the beginning few days which were hand tremors and couldnt sleep until I started taking the pill in the morning instead of the evening which corrected that problem. I think zoloft was a great antidepressant. I went from being a disfunctional depressed person to moderatly happy. I started out at 25 mgs and over the years increased from 100-150)  For me the drug was great and helped with anxiety tremendously. It is only recently I am trying to change to Wellbutrin because of the weight gain. (40 lbs) It so far has been hard to change.

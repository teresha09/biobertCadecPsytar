I started out on Effexor XR 75 mg, and was slowly raised from there to Effexor XR 300 mg. Then I was changed to the generic Venlafaxine XR 300 mg. I have had a lot of side effects with both of the medications, but it has been a life savor for me. I have been committed 3 times in the last 2 years. I was also getting 1 on 1 counselling but at the time I didn't have any insurance and the laws changed. So I had to start doing group therapy, and that didn't work. I always wanted to help others instead of helping myself. The Effexor XR worked wonderfully for me until about 2 1/2 years ago. I fell 4 1/2 years ago and broke my right ankle in 3 places and I ended up with RSD. Since then I have been in a power chair and I can do almost nothing by myself. I also ended up getting a blood clot in my right leg and was put in the hospital for that also. The Effexor XR worked so good for me with little or no side effects, until I was raised up to 300 mg. I feel that a lot of the side effects that I have are from the RSD not the Effexor XR. I am trying to get back into counselling now. The counselling does wonders for me. As far as the liver problems, the Dr. told me I had a fatty liver. I am also on morphine for pain from the RSD. I would recommend for anyone to take the Effexor XR. The help that it has done for me along with counselling out weighs the side effects by far.

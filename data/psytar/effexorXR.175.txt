dry mouth, insomnia if taken late in the day, However. I can't say these side effects outweigh the benefits. I'm on 225mg a day and this drug is the only one that has ever worked for me. I've tried so many, However, I'm ADDICTED I feel. I've tried to wean myself a few times and it's terrible. The nightmares and the sickness that goes with it are terrible besides the symptoms you had to begin with. It's just not worth it to me. I always tell my doctor, please don't start anyone, because once they get started, they'll never be able to stop. It's like a narcotic. The nightmares are the worst for me.

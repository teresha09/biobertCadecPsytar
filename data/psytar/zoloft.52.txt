Nausea, Increased perspiration, Increased heart rate, Weight loss (I've lost about 10-15 lbs, now I'm under 100lbs), Restlessness, Clenching my jaw, loss of appetite. I was on Zoloft for about a year. I stopped taking a year ago and have started again. It worked wonders the first time, but this time around I have been getting all of those symptoms. I take them at night with Trazadone for insomnia. So it doesn't keep me up like the doc told me it would.

weight gain, sweating, loss of libido, crave carbs - see additonal comments. effexor xr works well for my depression & anxiety. However, beware! I experienced loss of good judgement and loss of guilt when I started taking effexor xr. I quit my long-time job, divorced my husband of 17 years and moved out of state all in that first year! I highly recommend that you do not make any life changing decisions until you and your doctor see how this medication affects you at the onset of taking this drug. This adversely affected every aspect of my life - personal & financial. Never had thoughts of "suicide" only thoughts of "suing" the pharmaceutical company. Note that this happened at the onset of taking effexor and I had no warning of this type of side effect. I take effexor xr 75mg daily - truely do not know if I still need it. I am so afraid of the withdrawal & aftermath that I may be taking it the rest of my life. Very scarey thought.

jittery, disconnected feelings, suicidal thoughts, unable to function. I took one dose of this med and was lucky to be able to drive home from work. Within the first hour I had to call a friend to come over and sit with me while I waited for the effects to be over (which took hours). Worse than the worst "bad trip" you can imagine. Suicidal thoughts when I had NEVER had those thoughts before, Super scary. I would never take this again, Total poison! BEWARE!

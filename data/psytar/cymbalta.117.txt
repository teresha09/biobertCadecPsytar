constant numbness on the right side of my body, tingling fingers, unexplained extreme yawning, trouble staying asleep, anxiety, accelerated heart rate in mornings, dry-mouth when working out, new sweating that continues hours after working out, constipation, loss of appetite/cravings. I had lots of side effects the first 2-3 days of being on the 30 mg tablet, but most went away. I was kicked up to 60 mg starting week 2)  I felt much better, although not completely better. 4-5 weeks into 60 mg I started to have extreme numbness & tingling on my right hand, arm, side, shoulder blade. I continued having the listed side effects at week 5)  Doctors are unable to explain the numbness and think it is not associated with cymbalta. Numbness diminished after stopping the medicine & starting a new anti-depressant.

night sweats, trouble sleeping, heart racing, nervousness, weightloss but all of these gone away after a few weeks. Started on Effexor first hated the way it made me feel, Dr. switched me to lexapro without getting the effexor out of my system so I thought side effects were from the Lexapro and I quit. Few months later after effexor was out of my system I tried lexapro again first at 5mg and then went up to 10mg. I love it and I am finally feeling my old self again.

While I have been on Effexor, I have identified side effects like asexuality - also, other sexual side effects; including: Ejaculation problems, and reduced climax intensity. There are also more mild effects on my sleep - Night sweats, and vivid dreaming. I do not mind these as they are not bad enough to be particularly unpleasant.

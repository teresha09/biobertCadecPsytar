Be very careful with this . I took it for 3 months believe that its affect on the mind is indirectly linked to the immune system functioning . if you are an othewise phyically healthy human you may risk compromising the proper functioning of the T-cells which may have UKNOWN consequences, the worst being autoimmunce disease which will make you very sick with flu-like symptoms and unable to get better,please beware. I would only recommend that suicidal people with absolutely NO HOPE whatsoever take this. The risks of such dangerous and hidden physiological side effects are in NO WAY worth the potential positive effects of so-called subjective "mental stability" which is merely illusory and masks the hidden danger.

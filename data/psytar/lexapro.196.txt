Slight headache, upset stomach, decreased libidio but able to climax, slight increase in anxiety in the begining, increased dreaming. I started at 5mg for 4 weeks and just recently increased to 10mg. Since being on Lexapro my depression has lifted. It seems to be helping for anxiety as well but I also take .5mg of Klonopin twice a day. I am sleeping better much better. The side effects seem to get better each day and are nothing compared to those of the other meds I have tried, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta and Zoloft weren't the right fit but Lexapro seems to be. Hang in there and don't give up!

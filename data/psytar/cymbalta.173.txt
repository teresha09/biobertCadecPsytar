Jaw clenching, insomnia, excessive yawning, tiredness & nausea if not taken with food. Most of these side effects diminished markedly after 2 weeks. I wanted to make a positive comment about Cymbalta as there is a lot of negative out there on the internet. I noticed a major improvement in my depression after 2 weeks. The side effects that I experienced were not debilitating, the only one that bothers me is the waking through the night but I think that's improving now. I do not get any negative effects if I take my dose a couple of hours late. This is the 4th antidepressant I've tried in the past 6 months & the first to give me any relief from my depression. I was put off by all the negative comments, but am glad I went ahead. I think people are more inclined to post on these sites when they've had a bad time with a drug than when things are going well. I gave it a 4 out of 5 as it's still early days, but I'm very hopeful; I was in a bad, bad way before Cymbalta.

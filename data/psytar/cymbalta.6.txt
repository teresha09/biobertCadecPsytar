When I first started taking cymbalta I would wake up drenched at night from sweating. I felt like I was in a fog the whole time I was on this medicine. I was at 60mg and then dropped to 30mg for 2 weeks then stopped taking it. The withdrawl from cymbalta only took about a week for the dizziness to stop. I am still having brain zaps here and there, and my anxiety has returned. I would rather live like this though than be in a fog. It has only been two weeks since I stopped taking the med. If you do not feel like this drug is working, or any other AD please tell your Dr. I was on this drug a little over a year and in that time I continued to get worse contemplating suicide more than once. I had taken other AD's prior to taking cymbalta, but never experience the awful thoughts and feelings like I did with cymbalta. I now know why there is a black box warning on these meds. Cymbalta changed my whole thought process, I felt like I was in some sort of hell and couldn't escape. Now that I am no longer on this med. it is like day and night, I finally feel good again.

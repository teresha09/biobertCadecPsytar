nausea at first, which subsided after a couple of weeks. Still a bit sleepy during the day (I take it in the morning), but then frequent waking at night, with very vivid, weird dreams! I do feel more relaxed and able to handle life's ups and downs, as well as some serious family issues. I've gotten used to the side effects, and am sticking with it. Tough it out - things do get better, and your body will adjust!

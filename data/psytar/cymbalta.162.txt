Constipation, vivid dreams and restless sleep patterns. Overall this med helped me with my energy levels and fatigue. I know longer feel tired in the afternoons, I no longer cry at the drop of a hat and I feel alert and focused. Prior to taking this, I was a trembling, sappy mess who could not think about holding a job. Now I am on my second interview thanks to Cymbalta

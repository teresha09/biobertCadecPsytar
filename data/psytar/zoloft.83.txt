Just started taking it a few days ago. I find that I am constantly clenching my jaw and it feels "funny" when I yawn or smile. I also feel very, very groggy in the mornings and have to force myself out of bed, but once I'm up, the grogginess fades pretty quickly and I actually have energy throughout the day. I have also noticed that my mood has improved and I'm not weepy like before. So far so good.

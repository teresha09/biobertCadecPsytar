Night Sweats, Restless Legs, Take 150mg, and that, along with Provigil that I started a bit later, appear to have given my regular epilepy meds a push to stop my seizures, that were previously at 4-5 a day. I do sweat like a pig at night, am very flat emiotionally and have zero sex drive, which is good, because it also keeps my johnson from working very well. May sound like a crappy drug, but I'll take the side effects for no seizures any day.

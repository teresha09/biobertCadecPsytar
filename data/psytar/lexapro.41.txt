Nausea (for about 1 week), headaches, brain "zaps" occasionally, extreme sleepiness, vivid dreams, loss of sex drive. After being on Wellbutrin for about 6 months with good results, I went off medication altogether, Unfortunately, my depression returned with a vengeance after about 7 months. Went back to see a therapist. Still not too helpful. Went to see my Doc, was put on Lexapro 10mg. Some good results. Went to 20mg after some really tough life circumstances, Side-effects were unmanageable! Went back down to 10mg after 1 week on the higher dose. After 3 months on Lexapro and therapy, I will be switching to something else . perhaps Wellbutrin again? *BOTTOM LINE: you DON'T have to suffer through your depression, GET HELP! The most important thing you can do is see a therapist. Drugs are only a secondary issue. If you do need drugs, be sure to closely work with your Doc, report side-effects promptly, etc, Don't give up on yourself.

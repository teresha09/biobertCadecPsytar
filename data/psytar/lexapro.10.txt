Took a while to have an effect on mood obviously,but side-effects alarming:sudden migraines which I had had very infrequently before. Very big increase in blood pressure which I had never experienced before. Have your blood pressure checked even if like me, you have never had a problem with it you may be in for a nasty surprise!

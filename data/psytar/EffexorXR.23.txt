Effexor was awesome for relieving my depression! But then came the "Weaning Off" period! OMG,  Cold sweats, vomiting, dizziness, brain zaps (with noise). Thank God I was pregnant or I may NEVER have forced myself through to the other side! If a person knew how awful the withdrawal was, they would keep searching for other answers to their depression. I love the suggestion where a person opened their capsuals & removed a certain number of "beads" every day. I basically did the same thing on a day where I had a big commitment to my kids and knew I couldn't miss it. I opened the capsual and removed most of the medication. Put it back together & had relief from my symptoms in a few hours! If this drug is still going to be prescribed, a more appropriate taper method needs to be developed! Shame on the medical community for putting people through this type of misery!

am tired all day long/low energy. Start yawning early in the day and keep going until I go to bed. Have experienced weight gain. Exercising and dieting don't seem to get the weight off. A missed dosage causes symptons like the flu which will last for a couple of days. No longer have crying jags. Able to deal with anxiety better. Able to handle stress better and to look at the bigger picture before I would just jump off the deep end.

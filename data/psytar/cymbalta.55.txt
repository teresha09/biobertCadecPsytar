Nausea. Lots of nausea. Also, a marked reduction in sexual response and sensation. Also, spells of dizziness not associated with a change in position (randomly while sitting down or walking, not just upon standing up). No discernible effect on the depression after 8 weeks at recommended therapeutic dosage of 60 mg/day, at which point we decided that due to the already-present undesirable side effects, it would be a bad idea to try increasing the dose further.

MAJOR head pressure, dizziness, moodiness, agitation, no patience, insomnia, suicidal thoughts. Switched to Zoloft because Paxil didn't work anymore. The first dosage was 50 mg and after that increased to 100mg. The depression lifted a bit but the anxiety, head pressure, dizziness, insomnia were unbearable. Then the doctor increased it to 150 mg which made the head pressure worse so I slowly got back down to 100mg. I am still feeling head pressure which is causing my moodiness but the doctor doesn't believe me. If this head pressure will go away, I think I would be able to cope much better. I'm afraid to switch to another anti-depressent because the withdrawals that I've experienced from Paxil & Effexor was a nightmare and I know Zoloft has similar withdrawals. I guess I'll wait to see if this head pressure will ever go away.

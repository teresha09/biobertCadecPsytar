When I first started taking it. I confused the awful side effects for feeling more depressed & more anxious, so my doctor upped my dose. I was taking 300mg/day for about a year. Then I just couldn't handle the headaches it caused, so my doctor lowered my dose gradually over the last two years or so. Since taking Effexor, my life has been miserable, Can't sleep when I want to, can't stay awake when I want to, lethargic, dizzy, blurred vision, extreme fatigue, extreme increase in appetite. If I go more than two hours past my dose. I can't even see straight! My lips become numb. It's horrifying! I hate Effexor XR. The only good thing that's happened from taking it is now I realize my anxiety & depression are not as insurmountable as I thought - being on Effexor IS! I am down to 37,5mg/day and hope to be completely off in about a month. ONE WEEK since I decided to go off Effexor and I realize what it has done to my life! I see the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak, Don't take it - it's very nasty and you will regret it. Go for a run at the park - it feels great! You can't do that after being on Effexor a while, it makes you fat, exhausted & feel hopeless!

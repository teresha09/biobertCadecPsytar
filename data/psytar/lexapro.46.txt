No sex drive, dull mood. Generally felt pretty dull and had no sex drive whatsoever. I don't wanna be sad but does life really have to be that boring? I drank a lot while on this drug and it made me act kinda crazy. I know your not suppose to drink when on these meds, but I honestly feel the dull boring mood this drug created for me drove me to. Prior to taking this medication I was not much of a drinker, and now that Im off it I'm not either.

definatly get real nausious. I am having strong flu like symtoms but I am coming off of effexor and that has always been hardcore. I have been on effexor for 11 years and it has help me funtion and provide for my family, but I have been really tired and have to contantly fight weight gain. I have noticed that I have a little more energy and more mental clarity in the short time that I have been on Cymbalta. I'm going to stick it out and give this new drug several months before making a decision. God bless

Sweating, hand tremors, racing heart, insomnia, bizarre dreams. Cymbalta definitely helped with the depression. In 3 weeks it was gone, as was my anger and inability to focus. It's been somewhat effective with the anxiety, but I find valium works much better for that. As with any antidepressant, please, please be careful when taking this. And even though I found it effective, I agree that it is horrid to wean off of it. I've been going down 5 mg at a time a week at a time, and even so I've had withdrawls. I find taking just 1 mg of valium per day has helped a lot with the withdrawls. I had a friend who also went off Cymbalta and she took Adivan to help with withdrawls and that worked for her.

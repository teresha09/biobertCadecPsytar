No initial side effects except dry mouth which went away after a while (4 weeks or so). Had knee surgery while on Cymbalta where it was discovered I have severe osteoarthritis. I was taken off Cymbalta 6 weeks ago (per my request) and placed on another more affordable medication. I have since discovered that I have osteoarthritis in my hands and every joint in my body hurts. I think Cymbalta eased my osteoarthritis pain a great deal.

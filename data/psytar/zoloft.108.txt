At first nausea,diareah,shakiness, sleeplessness, brain zaps, muscle twitches, jaw tightness, vivid/scary dreams,loss of sex drive. The side effects were like living a second version of my personal hell. I stuck with it, and now I am realizing what a sad, pathetic, lonley, afraid, antisocial, hermit I used to be. Now people enjoy being around me. I am actually funny! I can make friends. I miss orgasms, but I like the person I am now a lot better than I was. I think I will stay on it for a while!

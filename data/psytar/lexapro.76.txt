Fatigue,dry mouth,constipation,memory loss,insomnia,low libido,and weight gain. I struggle to wake up in the morning, after finally getting to sleep. I have fluctuating hormones too. I am struggling to learn new things. I'm back in college. I take 10mg per day. I also take Wellbutrin XL. I've been on some kind of SSRI for 12 years. I also have a lack of motivation. I feel that I don't have passion about anything in my life. It's like not having emotions at all. I want to go off, but get the "brain zaps" really bad, Email me, if you know of something that might help.

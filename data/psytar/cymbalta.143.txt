Feelings of a band around my head, memory loss. unable to recall names etcdiarrhea, delayed processing,insomnia,late day fatigue. Some hair loss and some weight loss. These side effects are slowly letting up. Coming out of such a paralyzing depression is worth it! I'm just afraid it will eventually render me apathetic and flat the way Prozac eventually did. I'm also afraid my appetite will come back with a vengeance, as it has on other meds. If I end up a fat, bald middle aged woman I do think my depression will return in a different way.

want to get off this drug. If you miss a dose you get dizzy, confused, and have weird dreams. It is suppose to be not addictive but it has all the side effects of an addictive drug. I have gained weight and find it very difficult to lose it. I am tired most of the time, still depressed and very sad. I wish I did not take this drug.

very tired. head fog. went from effexor to cymbalta. felt tingling for the first 5 days. I have been on it for 2 weeks and I have finally seen the light. I have been feeling really good. Mood is great. but I can tell when it is time to take it I get this tingling feeling,like when I turn my head my brain is a bit behind. but other than that its been good to feel like life is worth living again.

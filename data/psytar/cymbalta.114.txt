loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea (subsided after a few days). I switched off of Prozac after being on that for around 2 years or so. I was hit with a lot of side effects of Cymbalta. My psychiatrist wants to now switch me to Zoloft. The loss of appetite and weight loss was one of the main side effects I had, I am already underweight, and losing weight isn't good for me

weight gain, fatigue, unable to orgasm during intercourse, insomnia, lack of sympathy, apathy, losing hair. Works well for depression and anxiety. I'm calmer during stressful times. I cannot orgasm during intercourse and I've tried everything. If I take the medicine at night I won't go to sleep. If I take it mid-morning I want to sleep in the afternoon so I take it first thing in morning. I have been losing hair. I have gained weight. I do feel bursts of happiness throughout the day.

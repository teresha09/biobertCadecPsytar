Nausea in morning, Dizziness, Heart rate increases quickly with exertion, occasional head rush, most distressing aspect is foggy thinking - sluggish thoughts. I am only on 37.5 mg of Effexor XR and have taken it for 6 days. The first day I was extremely nauseous and almost fainted when lifting a heavy object. Since then, it has improved my mood greatly but I think this is due to my inability to think about many things at once. my slowed mindset has prevented excessive worrying which caused my feeling sad and pessimistic in the first place. Unfortunately, I am being told by my physician that I am going to be gradually increased to 150mg/day since this is the typical treatment regime. I am nervous about this as I am uncomfortable with the loss of my cognitive capacity with this drug. This is the first time I have been treated medically for depression and I have not been diagnosed by a specialist.

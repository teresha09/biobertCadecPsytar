Day One - spacey, Day Two - nauseous, tight neck and head muscles, internal hot flushing accompanied by weakness and trembling, Day Three - nauseous, increased heart rate, warmer than usual, increased anxiety, Day Four - nauseous, digestive upsets, tight neck and jaw, prickling & tingling on skin, flushing, increased anxiety, experiencing zaps when falling asleep, woke in the middle of the night very hot, anxious, prickly, got scared, didn't take the med on Day 5, now decided I will try to tough it out, Day 6 - took it an hour ago. so far just tight neck and head muscles. Too early to tell. I've read enough posts that I think I need to just get through the hell of the first two weeks and then move up to 75 mg and see what happens. Very anxious (duh!) about the whole process.

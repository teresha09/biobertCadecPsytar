Nausea, Insomnia, Constipation, Crying, Dry Mouth, Sexual, "Speeding", Worsening Depression, Thoughts of Suicide, Jaw Clenching, Heart Racing. This is the most frightening experience I have ever had with an anti-depressant. I have a very high tolerance for drugs, and I have been on meds almost consistently for thirteen years, trying almost everything possible. Never have I had such side effects, nor have I ever felt as "drugged" as I did on Cymbalta: nervous and speeding. The side effects were almost immediate. Rarely do I ever think of suicide, but after two days the thought was almost constant. I woke up after three hours sleep each of the four nights, and could not get back to sleep. I was "speeding" the whole time, but felt no relief or, for that matter, a single positive effect. I would rather be depressed than feel like this-at least depression is predictable and I know it will end. I see that it worked well for some, but I would never take this drug again. The user comments for withdrawal were enough to stop me after four days.

Possibly dry mouth (whatever that is exactly), drowsiness for the first few weeks. Unlike the other people on here, I haven't really experienced that many side effects, or really any that are any sort of bother to me. Cymbalta has helped quite a bit (along with therapy and some life style changes) to help me get through depression. I wouldn't deter people from taking it. It definately hasn't been a miracle cure, but it hasn't been bad at all.

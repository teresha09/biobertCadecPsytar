Libido is decreased. This is a difficult med. to start as weird side effects ranging from head aches to 'whirring brain' effects and restlessness. I found they are minimal when increasing dosage by only 25mg at a time. It took months to settle in with this drug but it was so worth it. Dr. s do not understand the crazy side effects of starting this class of drugs and often move patients too quickly thru increases. Zoloft is amazing for me. I have learned how to raise and lower the dosage with the seasons/ light changes here in the north. I go from 200 mg in winter to 125 in the summer. I tried Celexa at one point but it caused memory problems right away. I wouldn't give up this drug for anything but you have to understand that small improvements occur across several months and you have to hang in there for the long haul.

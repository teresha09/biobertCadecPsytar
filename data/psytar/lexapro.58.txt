Extremely hard to climax during sex, Severe Depression. I would just stay around and do nothing all day. However when I did go out I was too numb to the world to have any panic attacks or jitters. At one point I wanted to kill myself. I have switched off to wellbutrin. Now my anxiety is up but my depression is decreasing. Oh sex no problem. I feel like im on a seesaw teetering between anxious and depressed. Alert and Zombie. Anyone please email me ideas.

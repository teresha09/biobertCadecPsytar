nausea, dizziness, spaciness, lack of coordination, massive headache in morning that lasts all day, feeling generally "hungover", lack of energy/motivation, dry mouth, jaw clenching, Dr. prescribed this to "give me a better outlook, engergy, and be able to face the day" because of depression related to death of parents/divorce/job cut/ and resulting overwhelming responsibilities related to those factors. I had a previous bad experience with Zoloft 10 yrs ago when a dr. misdiagnosed my hypothryroidism for depresssion instead. Was deadly sick for 2 wks and he kept me on it regardless, upped the dosage three times over a year because it wasn't working (duh, it was my thyroid!) That dr, is history, btw! This time, I was very leary of taking anything, Lexapro, this doc said has 'no side effects, the gentlest of meds, no addiction, no sexual side effects, etc). I disagree. I waited until the weekend to start, just in case problems arise, glad I did. Took Fri afternoon, nauseous and dizzy immediately, spaced out, went to bed for 2 hrs, got up, couldn't even make dinner, stumbling/spacey. Next day worthless and in a fog, bad headache. I waited and took the 2nd dose in evening after dinner so wouldn't have to deal with nausea/dizzy. Woke up with massive headache, felt like hit by truck, hungover-like. Got nothing done all day. Took 3rd dose again Sunday 10 pm before bed, and didn't get up until noon today (Mon). Called in sick. Headache still and completely useless, Coffee & tylenol so far- not helping much. Still in fog as I type this. Not sure if I want to continue.

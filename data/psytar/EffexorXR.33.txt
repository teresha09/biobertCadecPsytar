Horrible drug. Then side effects made me feel like hell. I wish I had never started taking it,  Terrible fatigue, malaise, asthma, lump in lower intestinal wall, sinus problems, muscles bones and joints so sore I cry. I feel like right side of my brain is numb, neck hurts horribly, and I'm short winded. I pray I come out of this. Hve been off of Effexor three and a half weeks. CARE ABOUT YOURSELF, DON'T TAKE IT!

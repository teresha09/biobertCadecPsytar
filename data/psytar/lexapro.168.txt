I have found myself waking up every 2-3 hours and general fatigue during the day. Loss of appetite. Since starting Lexapro about a month ago, have found myself extremely constipated, which I am assuming is a side effect. Also lack of sex drive. After listing all of the side effects, it may sound funny to say this, but I have loved Lexapro. I have been on Effexor and Wellbutrin XL as well as multiple anti-anxiety and anti-seizure drugs over the past year and a half. My mental health has been awesome. barely any anxiety or major depression symptoms which has made it easier to deal with the physical side effects. I would highly reccomend this drug.

Nausea & yawning for 1st month . Over last 6 months: difficulty reaching orgasm (F), loss of impulse control resulting in financial debt, increase in risky behavior, mania, lack of empathy, lack of emotional reactivity (haven't shed a single tear in over 6 months). Despite some of the side effects I like the increased energy and increase in social confidence. I've lost weight, increased activity, done better at work and get out and do things. I feel much more alive.

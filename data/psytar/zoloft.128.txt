These are side effects that continued throughout treatment with the drug. tiredness, increase in alcohol abuse/depenence (not near as bad as paxil), slightly decreased sexual desire(again not nearly as bad as paxil), somewhat decrease in energy, occasional euphoria. compared to paxil, zoloft reacts much better with me. I've been on and off of zoloft for a lot of years, and it has helped fairly well. However, it seemed to lose effectiveness after a few months. Then i had to increase the dosage (up from 50 mg). This always made me a little bit manicky. Now that i just started back on it, i'm experiencing the usual side effects when starting(tiredness, nausea, constipation, flucuations in mood and appetite, sweating). These subsided for me after about a week previous times i've been on it. It's a good first stab at trying an ssri in my opinion. if you are starting zoloft, start at low dosages and increase only if needed. Less is more. *Note* I am not a medical professional and have no medical training. This information is simply compiled from personal experience and remember that everyone reacts differently to these drugs so you may experience some/all/none ,or have other side effects i didn't mention.

Loss of sex drive, manic episodes, trouble sleeping. Was placed on Zoloft after suicide attempt. Although side effects were minimal, I started having severe manic episodes after a few weeks - driving 500 miles for no reason, not sleeping for days, etc Eventually I was taken off Zoloft and placed on Lamictal, which is now slowly reducing my manic episodes. Zoloft helped balance my mood after about a month, but the mania made my life more difficult.

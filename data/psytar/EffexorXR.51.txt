extreme fatigue, lack of motivation, wanting to sleep/rest all the time, sweating, hot flashes, weight gain, headaches, short term memory lapses electric shock/brain zap feelings with even 1 missed dose. If I could go back, there's no way I'd let a doctor push me into taking this drug. I took zoloft for years with no problems. Then after two stillbirths, I let my doctor push me into switching to effexor. The side effects have been terrible. Trying to wean off is even worse-the withdrawls are brutal. I  have insisted on stopping the effexor, and now the doctor is pushing pristiq (the "new and improved" effexor). I have declined and will be trying the zoloft again.

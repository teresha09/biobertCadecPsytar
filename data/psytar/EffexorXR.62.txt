Hypertension. Extreme anxiety attacks lasting for 3 full days and nights . after only 3 x 75mg tablets of effexor xr. I have been on Avanza (60mg) for about 18 months, and the doctor recently recommended adding 75mg of Efexor in the morning, and reducing the Avanza to 30mg at night, First day (Wednesday) was fine, second day (Thursday) i started getting anxiety attacks every couple of hours, leading up to around lunchtime when i found myself to be extremely agitated and in a permanent state of anxiety, the likes of which i have never experienced before . shakes, very panicky, extremely agitated and nervous, etc. Friday i was in two minds about taking the pill, but did it anyway, and the anxiety just didn't stop. I have not taken the effexor since Friday morning, it is now Monday and i am JUST starting to lose the anxiousness, not to mention the feeling of total exhaustion and loss of sleep. It was that bad that i basically have hidden all weekend, didn't answer the phone and was very apprehensive about even going downstairs to do the washing. At least i finally managed to get some sleep last night, with the help of 2 stillnox tablets. For me this drug has been shit and i will never take it again. The side effects are easily found on the net, so if you are a first timer, be wary of the side effects.

emotionless, Zombie effect. Loss of memory. When i took lexapro i walked around in a "zombie" like state because i would never be happy about anything, but never really sad. I just kind of felt numb toward all emotion, Also, my memory started lacking and i couldnt remember long periods of time or things i had done. i still have difficulty remembering most of that year and for no particular reason.

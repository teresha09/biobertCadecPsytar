at first had some anxiety and still have insomnia, usually after sleeping only 4 hrs. in the past two months have had three severe colds that start with flu-like symptoms and then have severe congestion lasting a couple of weeks. Cymbalta has definately helped me with nerve/muscle pain and with depression. Concerned about the colds (3 in 2 month) and severe congestion. I have rarely gotten any colds in the past and having 3 this Spring (06) is alarming. Please contact me if you also have cold symptoms and you think it's from the cymbalta. Thanks.

Constant yawning,severe tremors,headache, lost all sex drive the first day, couldn't orgasm if I tried, terrible jaw clenching, helped somewhat with social anxiety, but general anxiety got worse, panic attacks increased,. I was given this med by doc along with Wellbutrin. The sexual side effects were supposed to be countered by the Welly, Didn't happen. I have not had sex for 6 months which is putting a strain on the relationship. SO a little annoyed, but she has just gone through menopause and doesn't seem to be in the mood anyway. I have quit cold turkey about 3 weeks ago hoping some sex drive will come back. I am feeling some withdrawl now, I cry at anything. Anxiety is now though the roof, hands feet sweating, and my memory sucks. I cant tolerate SSRI's so will have to try something else.

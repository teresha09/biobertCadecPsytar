Constipation (1200 mg calcium gel caps is a remedy), the first day I experience,d 1 or 2 hrs of nausea first day only, dizziness has been eliminated by taking the 60 mgs at night ! 1 brain zapper after 10 months during a migraine headache which was a very sharp pain that radiated from my head and downmy back that was shocking and lasted a total of maybe 1 second. I have relief from major depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts are becoming fewer, I also take 200 mg of zoloft which I find to be less affective compared to cymbalta. Yesterday, Christmas day began with a crying episode that I could NOT shake for several hours that included hopelessness in a major way. I was Determined NOT to remain depressed so I first tried 1/2mg ativan followed by an additional dose of 60 mg of cymbalta. Gradually over 3 hrs the heavy dark shroud of miserable depression began to fall away. It has been over 24 hrs. NO DEPRESSION. This was my miracle on Christmas day. Uncertain about night and day sweats as that has been around for a decade due to menopause and a total hysterectomy. I sleep at night, no nightmares and my dreams are , REALLY VIVID as I am a VISUAL ARTIST. I do wake up refreshed. A few times I have experienced theo peripheral shadows, 1 second, then gone but I now realize what they are and they no longer scare the hell out of me. I will accept the annoying side affects if cymbalta continues to keep the grim reaper, depression and anxiety, OUT of lifejourney. I look forward to each step where scientists take one further towards a better life for those who suffer. Hopefully this forum of exchange will be a step forward in reaching the cure all miracle drug. In the mean time take advantage of the progress that have been made. Blessings to all of you who still suffer. Oh, sex life; try a roller coaster ride to work you up to it .

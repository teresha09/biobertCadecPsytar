At first, all the usual (dry mouth, dry eyes, tight jaw, dizziness, stoned feeling, nausea) but they went away after a month. Then after a few months, more serious effects that I now believe were from the Lexapro started, like all-over itching and severe middle back pain, especially at night and upon waking in AM. When I reduced dose from 20 mg to 10, both completely went away. Now I have terrible acne and infected cysts under one arm and might go off it all together to see if connected. Lexapro really helps with my anger problem, especially toward my kids and husband. I did go off for a month and the inappropriate anger came right back so now I'm thinking of switching to another SSRI that doesn't cause back pain, cysts and itching, not to mention wanting to sleep 13 hours a night.

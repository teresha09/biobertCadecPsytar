Erectile disfunction, delayed orgasm, lack of libido. Feel disconnected from my emotions, apathetic, no creativity or motivation, can't focus, Extremely tired, loss of appetite, slight twitching, agitated, slight abdominal pain. I have never been on any other antidepressant, and my doctor immediately put me on this. Let me tell you, _do your research first_. I didn't know anything about this kind of drug and dove into taking it as prescribed without a second thought, and I regret it, even after 2 days I'm hating it. The side effects alone make my previous bouts of depression seem pleasant. I'd rather have emotions.

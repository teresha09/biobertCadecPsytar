At first I had super dry mouth and wanted to sleep forever. That went away and then I had terrible problems reaching orgasm. After 6 weeks or so my sex drive vanished completely. My depression was gone until after about 5 months then the Zoloft just stopped working. I found if I took a year off the Zoloft, it would work again later so that's what I do. I have tried almost all classes of anti depressants and so far this works the best. I get all aspects of my life back together; career, social, family, spiritual. My love life suffers due to the lack of sex but it lets me focus on other areas. I have been on and off Zoloft for 5 years and found that staying at a dose of 25mg each morning is the best. Increasing the dose only increased the side effects. Zoloft let me still feel sad or angry at times, it didn't make me a complacent, happy person. It helpped me to feel the appropriate feelings for a situation instead of the all consuming feelings of doom and self loathing. Without antidepressants I am sure I would have kiled myself by now. No matter what the side effects are it's worth it to get me back on my feet and let me feel good for a change.

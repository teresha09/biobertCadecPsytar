Woke up this morning with jitters. That subsided around 10am, That's when I noticed how much of a space cadet I was feeling. My head was in an unbelievable fog. I was able to focus and concentrate and hold conversations but I just felt in a daze. It is now almost time for bed/my next dose and I still have that feeling in my head and slight headache. I wish I could give this time to kick in but really I had problems while I was at work today and can't do the adjustment period. If you can hang in there like other people on this forum than god bless you. But I think I'm going to try other methods right now . I just don't think I can put myself through hell for a few weeks like this. You seriously feel worse than you did without the medication . its hard but if you can hang in there then do it.

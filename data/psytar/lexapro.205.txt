Decrease in Sex Drive, Flat Mood, Sleeplessness. This drug has helped me a great deal. My anxiety is almost completely gone and my depressed mood has mostly lifted. My only complaints thus far are my lack of sex drive and my mood can be a little flat at times. I have had a hard time falling asleep on this drug. so I take Trazadone at night to help me fall and stay asleep.

The first week or two was bliss! I loved the stuff. After that came a week or two of nail biting and jitters (like when you drink a quad shot of Starbucks coffee) No negative sexual side effect - delayed ejaculation like every one else. is that really so bad! The only thing is I'm a little obsessive compulsive and that part of my personality has not been damped very muchin the long run, after a year of meds. I like these med lots. I battled for a long time if I should seek meds as a solution to my depression, and after one year and one dose increase to 100mg I feel like a person who is on top of my game. The long dark wet winters don't bother me. I always have the energy and positive attitude to do what I want - not the negative depressed attitude I used to have. I used to get very nervous about being around other people and interacting with others. Now I actually enjoy being the center of attention and even seek out new friends. I cant say that Ive had any negative side effects from taking this medication. Sometimes counseling just isnt enough to battle having little confidence in your self and a depressed attitude about life. Zoloft just allowed my true inner being (the person I am when I am by myself) to be displayed on the outsidefor others to enjoy me as a person; so they can be positively influenced by me.

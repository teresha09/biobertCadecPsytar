inability to reach orgasm, but only for a short time when first startted and when upped dosage, weird "brain zaps" others mention and vivid dreams when miss a dose, inability to get off it due to withdrawl symptoms - physical and emotional, but I was only trying to get off to start another antidepressant, so didn't really have to get off it. I have been on an antidepressant for 18 years, most have worked (except for welbutrin) and I switched around to avoid side effects from some and to try to get better relief of anxiety. None have helped my anxiety. Effexor has worked for my depression very well, would not be alive without it.

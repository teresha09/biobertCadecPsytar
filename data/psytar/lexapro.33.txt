dry mouth, severe thirst, hot flashes all over my body, tightness in my chest, severe diahrea, fuzzy mind, freaquent urination, lost 25 pounds in two weeks, muscle aches, flu like symptons, stomach cramps and tiredness. i experienced all these symptoms after just one 10mg pill and still sufering the side effects two weeks later. i would not recomend anyone take this medication for any reason. it's too dangerous, unless you have a doctor who will listen to you.

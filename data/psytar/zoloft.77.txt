Initially - zombie like feeling, no emotions, intense yawning; Ongoing - extreme fatigue, ZERO sex drive, chills (that is  feeling like someone is walking over my grave. not cold chills), TMJ (from clenching jaw at night). I've been taking Zoloft for a year. During the first month or so I noticed a definite decrease in my anger and anxiety. However, after a few months, I feel like all I want to do is drink. I'm still depressed pretty bad and that has yet to go away. My anxiety is more under control, but not gone. I'm thinking about upping my dose and going to AA for the drinking. It seems like I've become an alcoholic since starting Zoloft. I have NO sex drive and am always tired. I also get bouts of suicidal thoughts.

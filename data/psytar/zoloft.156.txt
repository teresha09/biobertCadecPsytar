intese dislike for people who use these forums to use language that clearly idenitfies them as an IDIOT. As I am reading this forum, I noticed one or two (maybe same person) people using bad language & "dissing" the use of Zoloft. Personally I have had success in using Zoloft and feel that if a person has an honest opinion, then by all means, express it. But, words like this person is using (you know which words I am referring to) simply confirms that this person is sorely uneducated and is ignorant of the fact that the english language has many more options than what they are aware of. My suggestion is to get a Thesaurus & a Dictionary & get studying! (and leave this forum to those who want to help themselves & others)

Not sleeping, chills and fever, inability to drink alcohol. This drug works wonders, can feel it working immediately. This is the best I have felt in many years. I didnt realize how bad I was. All the anxiety and doom and gloom have just dissappeared. This is a very powerful drug and anyone that takes it needs to decide what is important, the drug works but it is a seriously strong drug and has many many crazy side effects. I only sleep a few hours a night, have chills, and feel like I am on speed or extacy, but wow, i feel so much happier. My family and friends have all noticed how happier I am. It works, but the questions is, are you ready to deal with a drug this powerful?

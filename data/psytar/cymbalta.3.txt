Dizzy, nauseous, sweating, anxiety, uneasiness, restlessness, shivers,. Over the last 14 years I have taken many antidepressants and have never experienced anything like this. I was give a doctors sample for 60mg which was probably too high to start out as most seem to start with 30mg. I took it this morning at 8am and by 10 I was feeling off, by 1pm I had to go home. I could not explain the experience I was having to my wife. Finally at 3pm I realized that this was the closest I've felt to doing LSD (yes I do know). Unfortunately, all the similar symptoms were the bad ones. It is now 12 hours later and it still feels like LSD but I'm getting more flu like symptoms now. Seriously, I was hesitant to take this drug when I was reading some articles last night but I decided to do it anyways. I found this page just now and after reading many comments I had to post my own. Nothing that makes me feel like this could end up doing me any good. I do not envy those who want to come off this drug but are afraid to.

occasional sleeplessness; @ 225 mg/day - very difficult to orgasm, not as bad @ lower doses. Withdrawal symptoms are horrible - as noted by others. Withdrawal is an awful experience - I've tried (and made it) several times, but within 2 months the darkness just settles on me again and I have to start taking it again. I haven't even tried quitting in about 3 years. Taking 225 mg for the past year and it doesn't work as well as it used to; previously 150 mg kept me very even and I was well-pleased. Increased stress in my life for the past year and effexor xr hasn't been able to keep up. Not sure which way to go now.

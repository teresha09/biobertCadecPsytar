initially, I was very tired for the first few weeks; no side effects after that. It has really helped with my depression. I had tried St. John's Wort and Wellbutrin, but my doctors switched me to Cymbalta after a back injury. It doesn't really reduce the pain at all, but it helps make it easier to bear the pain.

Extreme fatigue, difficulty waking up, emotional numbness/detachment, inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, lack of interest in ANYTHING except sleep, inability to reach orgasm with a partner, weakness, excessive urination, dizziness. It certainly erased the anxiety, but I hardly feel human anymore. Nothing moves or excites me. I'm now in the last stage of withdrawal, and I'm still experiencing the fatigue and dizziness and sexual apathy. I'll take depression any day over this.

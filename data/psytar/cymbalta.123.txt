insomnia, loss of appetite*. I took Cymbalta because I was out of Lexapro. Cymbalta lifted my mood more. My mind raced at 100 miles a minute, but my body was exhausted, so sleep was slim. The loss of appetite I wasn't sure to attritube to the Cymbalta because I'm a finicky eater anyway, but I couldn't function with only 5 hours of sleep in 10 days.

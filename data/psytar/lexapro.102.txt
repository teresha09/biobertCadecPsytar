fuzzy "high" feeling, sleepy, can't stop yawning. It's six days now and the obsessive endless thoughts about a bad event in my life are already subsiding. I noticed that almost from day one. I feel calmer, That's all good. On the down side, I feel as if I'm in a fog. I can still do my work, but I want to SLEEP and I wake up groggy. Kind of reminds me of the few times when I've been sick and taken sudafed, except there's more sleepiness. It's not exactly a pleasant feeling and I hope that it'll pass, as I am not interested in remaining a semi-zombie-there are lots of things I want and need to do in my life. I am taking 5 mg. Can orgasm easily so far (I've been checking), If anything, my appetite's diminished, But it's only been 6 days, and I expect things will change.

Less depression, although still had low-moderate level at times, but couldn't "feel" much of anything. Emotionally numb. Didn't cry at my own sister's funeral! Felt numb, robot-like. Also couldn't orgasm. Cymbalta seemed to deaden everything. Reduced dose now to 30 mg and already feel myself coming alive. This is a strange med, and I've been on a lot!

sexual side effects, nausea, drowsiness, "brain zaps", dizziness, weight gain. The drug did what it was supposed to do, but it's the withdrawal symptoms that occur from lessening the dose, or tapering off the medicine. These adverse effects are horrific and make it very difficult to function for a period of at least 2 weeks. While I was taking this drug, I would experience these side effects if I missed ONE dose. By the next morning, I would barely be able to get out of bed, had dizziness, brain zaps, nausea, headaches, excessive sweating/urination that often lead to dehydration, etc. When I tapered off this medication, over a period of 2 months, these effects were 10x worse and lasted for about a week each time I lowered my dose.

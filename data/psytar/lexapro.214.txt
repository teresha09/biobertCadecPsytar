horrible inability to swallow, shortness of breath, extreme decreased appetite, increase in energy, vivid nightmares, extreme decrease in the amount it takes to get drunk. my 5th day on it was the best day of my life, amazing. working well i am 100 times better with people. i love it. started at 10 then 20)  looking forward to future increased effects and hopefully some weight loss and HOPEFULLY the swallowing thing will go away. i also get crazy drunk with less alcohol.

had been terribly tired for months. My doctor suggested I try taking the Cymbalta at night instead of the morning because he thought that was what may be making me tired. Since then, I have had moderate insomnia. I will go back to taking it in the morning and see if it helps. My doctor increased my dosage from 60mg to 120mg She had just went to a seminar on the study of cymbalta. The study showed that by doulbling the dose it helps to control the appetite in some people. Since then, I have felt so much better. I don't feel as tired and I have not had all of the food cravings that I usually have. So, I will stick with it and see how it works out.

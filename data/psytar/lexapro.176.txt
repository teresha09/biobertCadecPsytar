headache, dizziness, loss of sex drive, insomnia. I have only been taking lexapro for three weeks but I am thrilled with the results so far. It may have been placebo effect, but I felt relief from anxiety after my second pill. I had headaches the first few days but those have already gone away. I feel like a new person and wish I'd gone on the medication a long time ago! Looking back I didn't realize how far off from normal I had become. I feel as though I've been disconnected from life for so long, now I feel much more like I can live in the moment.

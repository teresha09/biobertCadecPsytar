The first couple of days I noticed slight dizziness within an hour or so of taking it but it resolved itself. Dry mouth also for the first few days. Insomnia was horrid the first 2-3 days, not sleeping but 2-3 hours each night. Other than that, nothing - until week 3 when I all of the sudden experienced moderate nausea/vomiting and pretty good dizziness constantly. Also, about a 5 lb. weight loss in the 3 weeks I took it. Decreased appetite. I'm disappointed. I debated and debated whether to try an anti-depressant and finally decided to go with Zoloft because I am nursing my 1 year old. I decided at this point the potential risk to my daughter was outweighed by my extreme mood swings/impatience/anger in general towards my kids. I started low, 25 mg's the first 7 days, then increased to 50)  The first couple of days were rough with the insomnia but when that cleared up I felt fine, like I wasn't taking anything. It wasn't until the 3rd week that I started to feel as though I had the flu. I went to the dr. and he said no way could it be the Zoloft, said I had the stomach flu. Well, this lasted for 7 full days and I stay home with my 3 small children, it wasn't working! Today, I decided enough and did not take it. So far, no "withdrawal" effects but I'll be darned if I feel great. No nausea/dizziness like I experienced yesterday and the 7 days prior. I really wanted this to work and I do think it mellowed me out a bit, I wasn't so on edge, so jumpy and moody and irritable. I just can't go on indefinitely feeling like I was going to fall over or vomit all day.

On 300mg: crazy dreams, periods of night sweats, constipation, decreased short term memory, decreased attentiveness. Withdrawl over 12 weeks: diarrehea (slowly settling down), headaches immediately after dose decrease, for a few days (gne now). Nails have gone hard. Minor emotional periods (sad, angry) for only a few days each. Been 3 weeks off and have had pretty bad joint pain for last week. Yes I had some minor side effects but my quality of life was vastly improved while I was on this medication. I was very happy in how it dealt with my depression. Without taking it I would have not been able to achieve the things I have personally or professionally.

Insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, nausea. I had a really rough year last year which included a fmaily member dying, getting out of a bad relationship, and almost getting kicked out of school. My doctor put me on 30mg for a week then bumped me up to 60mg which I've been on for 2 months. It has worked wonders for me. The best time for me to take it is around 5pm with a good meal. This gets rid of nausea and lessens the insomnia and dry mouth. I take a stool softener to help with the constipation. I get to taper down to 30mg in about 3 weeks then eventually get back to normal life

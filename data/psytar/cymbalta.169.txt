vertigo, sweating, vivid dreams(though at times quite entertaining). I wanted to add some comments that I forgot. My weight has been the same during the entire time I have been on Cymbalta. I have had no sexual side effects. I feel that it IS still working for the joint pain and somewhat for the depression, however, not as well as it was and I'd rather not increase the dosage. Instead my doctor has added Prozac, 10mg I can't offer any feedback on that yet, because today is the first day I have taken it. I have been on Prozac in the past, Lexapro-which worked great for a year then nothing, and coming off of it was horrible. I choose to stay on Cymbalta because of it's wonderful help with my joint pain. I honestly could not function as I do without it. I had no idea that it was used for fibromyalgia patients and the lack of pain was noticed before the help with the depression. I wish it didn't make me sweat more but it's a side effect I'll live with. To anyone that is trying it and experiencing some of the dizziness and nausea, I encourage you to stick it out. It DOES get better!

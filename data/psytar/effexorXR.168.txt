night sweats, dreams, possibly increased appetite. I seem to be quite fortunate. I started out taking 300 mg of Effexor and am now down to 150 mg At 300, I had very bothersome night sweats. This was greatly improved by dropping the dose to 225)  With my doctor's permission, I've recently dropped the dose to 150 mg I was wondering if the drug was increasing my appetite and if a lower dose might make a difference. But, I'm still about 10 pounds heavier than I'd like and at this point, I don't think I can blame it on Effexor. I suffered no major side effects when lowering the drug - just some light headedness that lasted a couple of days.

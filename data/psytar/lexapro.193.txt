Bad: Nauseated and jittery for the first few days, like a sugar crash or a caffeine high, Good: I am sleeping like a baby for the first time in years. I wake up feeling refreshed and rested, almost instantly alert. If I am sleepy at all the next day, it is because I was unable (due to my schedule) to get a full eight hours' sleep, not because of the Lexapro. When I get eight hours. I have no sleepiness at all. I was on Wellbutrin prescribed by my PCP but she sent me to a psychiatrist because I was still very depressed. The psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro because I was also having severe mood swings and rage along with the depression, completely stressed out and unhappy. He started me on 10 mg per day, and I can honestly say that I feel better than I have ever felt in my life. Crises are quickly put into perspective. I feel hopeful and happy and content, the kids' antics don't wig me out like they used to. The fact that I am sleeping better, too, is a bonus, because I was having a terrible time sleeping more than three hours at a time and spent a couple of hours each night tossing and turning, Not anymore! I love it! I am so happy to have finally found something that is working for me.

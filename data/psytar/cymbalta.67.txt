WEIGHT GAIN DESPITE REDUCED CALORIE INTAKE, frequent nausea, vivid dreams to the point that is difficult to wake from them, head rush that made me think I was having a stroke, disassociation, spaciness, horrible withdrawal symptoms-so NOT quit suddenly or on your own. Withdrawal similar to heroin withdrawal. THIS MEDICATION IS GOD AWFUL AND IT SHOULD BE BANNED.

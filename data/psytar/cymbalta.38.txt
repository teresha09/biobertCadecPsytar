Severe fatigue, problems staying asleep, slight nausea. I have been on Cymbalta for almost a week and have been in bed the entire time. It has caused me to be severely fatigued with flu-like symptoms that came on about 24 hours after beginning this drug. The depression was not as bad as I feel on this medication. I am supposed to go to 60mg in two days but after reading the reports of the great difficulty in getting off Cymbalta - I am going to stop taking it before it gets even worse.

My first language is not english so bear with my spell. When I whent fron efexor xr 75 to 150 inmeditely i start feeling very warm in the stomag and sleppless in about three weeks after I en up in the emmergency room with 57 of hemoglobin concentration out of 135 they have to give me 4 bags of blood and I stayed there for three days, during those days I did not take the efexor but on the fourth day when I came out of the hospital I was feeling very dizzy so I took the efexor again with food in the morning and later I eat two kiwis and I felt so much pain in the ulcer caused by efexor that I had to drink a lot of milk to calm down the horrible pain. Today I have'nt take it and I eat somethin spicy and greasy and my stomag just blouwed but no pain. I have never had stomacal problems prior to efexor until now so I am goin to stop taking it but taping it down I let you know how I recover from my ulcer and the other side effects.

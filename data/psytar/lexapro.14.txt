Fatigue, dizziness, apathy, muscle jerks, jaw clenching, interfered with Thyroid replacement medicine, insomnia. I'm surprised that there were any positive ratings. I took this for two months, hoping that the side effects would ease. Most had except for the apathy and fatigue . just wouldn't go away. Doctors did not tell me that I needed to increase my Thyroid medicine as recommended by the manufacturer of the thyroid medicine. I became more tired, cold and weak after about 6 weeks so I had to discontinue. The withdrawal process has been very difficult. It apparently doesn't take a long time for this medicine to build up toxic levels in your blood and liver as well as affecting your brain. Even though I tapered down in 1/4 pill increments, the worst withdrawal symptoms happened to me after I completely stopped, Dizziness, headaches, neck pain as well as muscle stiffness throughout the body are main complaints. Why is this product legal?

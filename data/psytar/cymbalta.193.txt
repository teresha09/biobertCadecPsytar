nausea at first, but that went away. Lost some weight, keeps me from eating like I was. I was already taking Wellbutrin but the depression was the worst I had ever had and doctor added the cymbalta 30 mg a day. I had high blood pressure and migraines so Inderal was added. I feel like a different person, feel so much better. Am afraid now the doctor will take me off this combination. Blood pressure is back to normal, cut down on the inderal to 20 mg a day. I have read the side effects of coming off the cymbalta, sounds really scary. Doctor mentioned me being on the cymbalta for about a year. Has anyone been on the cymbalta longer and with the combination of other meds that I am taking.

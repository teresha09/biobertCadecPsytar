Depression, major nausea, shaking, heart arrhythmia, trouble sleeping, dizziness, fuzzy brain, memory loss, feeling faint. This is a TERRIBLE drug and definitely should not be prescribed for elderly patients or anyone for that matter. The withdrawel is quite severe and I went through hell going off this drug! Wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy except to the Doctor who recommended this drug! Ended up having to have a pacemaker put in because of the heart fibrillation.

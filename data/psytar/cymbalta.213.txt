nausea about 4 hours after taking the med lasting rest of the day,sweating in the face, severe constipation. Ihave only taken cympalta for 5 days and already I feel like a new person. My mood and energy are better than they have been in months. I feel like i have found my light at the end of the tunnel. 1st week taking 30 mg will be going up to 60mg in 2 days. I take this in addition to 150mg per day of wellbutrin and this has helped every aspect of my life already! I LOVE IT!

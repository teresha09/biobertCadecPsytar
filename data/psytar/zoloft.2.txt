This medication caused me, like so many other people with bipolar disorder, to freak out. I cut off all my hair and took the remaining 40 pills after taking about 10 pills as prescribed so it did not take long for me to get into this semi-suicidal state. Be careful of taking this if you have bipolar disorder!

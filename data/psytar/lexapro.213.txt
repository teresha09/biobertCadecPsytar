5 lb weight gain initially. This has saved my life, literally. I had been through several antidepressants trying to get something to work. Finally came across Lexapro. It worked at 10mg, but only relieved about 50% of a very severe depression. Increased to 20mg 3 months ago and it fully resolved my depression. I feel with feelings (not "numbed"), can cry, laugh and enjoy life. I am much more enjoyable to be around and work well at my job now.

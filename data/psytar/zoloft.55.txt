Shortly after taking this medication I would get severe stomach cramps that would last a few minutes. I also had the desire to drink alcohol heavily and got really drunk really fast. I was on Lexapro before going into remission, but since I didnt have insurance and Lexapro cost moe than $100 per month my Dr. put me on Zoloft as a cheap alternative. Zoloft did nothing for my depression, just made me crave alcohol ( I was not a heavy drinker before or after taking Zoloft). Only stayed on it for a couple of weeks then Dr. switched me back to Lexapro.

Initially experienced loss of appetite & weight loss. I also experienced an initial period of emotional numbness by which I mean I didn't feel I was experiencing my emotions normally no matter what it was I was feeling. Now I find I have extremely vivid & bizarre dreams- some good, some bad. Sweating has definitely increased as well as heat sensitivity. I also found that after the initial period of appetite & weight loss, my appetite went back to normal & I have since gained quite a bit of weight. I haven't experienced any sexual side effects which is a plus but I am really not happy about the weight gain. I feel as though I have reached a plateau in my progress. For a while I felt as though things were really improving, but recently it things seem almost like they were before I started.

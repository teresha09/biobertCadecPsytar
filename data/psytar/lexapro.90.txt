nervousness/shakiness, occasional "electrical zaps" that so many people report with SSRI's, diahrrea and constipation, the urge to drink more alcohol. Lexapro has helped with my depression, but not so much the anxiety. started at 5mg and am now at 15mg after about a month. doctor wants me to go up to 20mg, but i'm not sure about that. I've taken many ssri's (paxil cr, zoloft, prozac) and this one isn't much different. I've been noticing that the times i was on an ssri, i drank a lot more alcohol than when not on one. Paxil was especially bad in this case, However, lexapro has had no effect on my libido, In fact, it may have increased it, ssri's are notorious for killing one's sex drive but this drug hasn't in my case.

Nausea, vertigo and extreme fatigue to begin with (first week or so). Emotions were very flat for the first month or so. The nausea subsided but still suffer from the fatigue and horrible night sweats. Also very low libido and anorgasmic (difficulty achieving orgasm). Finding it very difficult to come off the medication now. Very severe withdrawl after only one day of not taking the drug, which include disorientation, vertigo, nausea and what they (weblog which supports users coming off Cymbalta) call 'brain-zaps' where you experience some kind of electrical shock type feeling in your brain. Very disconcerting and unpleasant! As a result I am afraid of coming off the medication.

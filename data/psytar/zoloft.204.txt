The first week or so I felt a little weird but once the medication kicked in, it was great. I have been on Zoloft for three years(25mg). This medication saved my life. I was very depressed and felt as if I was always disoriented. I wasn't able to sleep at night because I always felt like I was going crazy. I realized I had a chemical inbalance and once zoloft began working for me I was able to get a full nights sleep without waking up feeling like I was spinning or experiencing some kind of psychosis. I wanted to end my life and zoloft really has helped me kick the depression and suicidal thoughts. I take the brand medication zoloft, not the generic. This medication works wonderful for me. You have to sometimes try a few before you find the right one.

constipation, fatigue, weight gain, blocked tears and sad feelings that still existed inside of me. I took Lexapro together with Wellbutrin to "correct" concurrent depression and anxiety. At the time I started the drugs, I was in a major depression. Wellbutrin helped immediately to let me think entire thoughts again (without interruptions in my thinking because I felt so sad.) Adding Lexapro improved my mood. I started at 5 mg and worked slowly up to 20 mg. After 2 years at 20 mg, my thoughts became bitchy and impatient again. My psych recommended increasing the lexapro dosage to deal with it. I chose the opposite path: I tapered off both Lexapro and Wellbutrin and am focusing on nutrition and exercise to keep my mood steady and generally positive. Psychiatrist disagrees with my approach and says Lexapro is a drug for life. I am sleeping more deeply now, without the intense anxious dreams that I had on the drugs. I will go back on them if I have to, as they did keep my super sad thoughts at bay. Personally I think these drugs were a life saver to get me through

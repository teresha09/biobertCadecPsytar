started on 37.5mg about 3 years ago, I am now on 225mg, whenever dose is increased I begin to have severe tiredness, sleeping for 12-16 a night! I also gain weight whenever the dose is incerased, and I have TONS of food cravings. I honestly can't tell a difference when I am on or off of Effexor XR, except for the terible migranes that I experience when missing a dose.

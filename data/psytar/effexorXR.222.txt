like I drank one too many cups of coffee. After being prescribed effexor XR I read the comments on this site and was terrified to try it. My pharmacist convinced me that it was safe for me to use along with my topamax, and encouraged me to try it. I'm really glad I did. I feel SO much better. I can face the world again.

After 2 weeks I had terrible acid reflux which I NEVER had before, constipation, stomach ache 24/7, then rectal bleeding which scared the heck out of me. Got off the drug immediately. Because of the bleeding I had to go for a colonoscopy and have my stomach biopsied which showed it cause the lining of my stomach was inflammed. It took me 2 weeks to be weaned off the medication and I felt awful all over like I had the flu. I was only on 20MG and it worked mentally but to this day, my gastro-intestinal system is screwed up. I do have to say, I was taking Advil and noticed on TV now there are now warnings about taking over the counter pain relievers with this medication.

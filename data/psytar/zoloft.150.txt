Severe insomnia,weight fluctuations. Once you eat a bite, you don't feel full and crave SUGAR. Works for my form of depression, however it has destroyed my sleeping patterns. Dosage of zoloft is 50 to 150 mg range. I started taking AmbienCR to sleep but at 12.5mg it only helped for 4 hours. I asked doctor about supplementing Zoloft with Trazadone(antidepressant) and he agreed. Trazadone puts me to sleep in 20 minutes. There is synergism (works well together) with the two antidepressants. Currently 50mg Zoloft and 125mg Trazadone. Not sure what ratio will work yet but if I can't sleep, I can't function so I will continue to find balance. I researched Zoloft and literature says 50mg is max dosage. Anything over and it does not help(but I see many take it at higher dosage and my psych. doctor typically prescribes at much higher dosages to patients. This worries me. If sleep is still issue over long term I will look into subsituting Zoloft for something else.

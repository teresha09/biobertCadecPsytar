felt a little nausea the first day. I have a hot flash type of feeling the first few hours after taking it. I sweat a little more and my sex drive has decreased somewhat. I feel amazing on cymbalta! I could tell a difference the first day. By the second week when I went to the 60 mg I felt like a different person. I have fewer panic attacks. I don't get mad as easily as I did at my kids. I actually get up and do house work after dinner instead of lay on the couch. My 8 hour work day goes by so much better. I highly recomment it to anyone. My side effects are/were so mild if you are depressed this drug is worth trying. Of course I haven't had to try to get off of it yet. That might be a different story!

felt physically ill during the first 3 weeks at 60 mg on this med. While that subsided, I then felt a progressive feeling of being in a general stupor. Lethargy, significant effects on short-term memory to the point it was affecting my ability to work efficiently. I finally took myself off and have been experiencing significant dizziness to the point of being concerned about driving. For a mild depression, I would not recommend.

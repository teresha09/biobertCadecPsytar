At greater then 50 mg experience sexual side effects. Bad vivid dreams. Been on 50 mg for 10 years. I am sure it probably isn't doing anything for me except a crutch. If I increase to 100 I have sexual side effects immediate. It helped a lot at the beginning when I had anxiety attacks and depression. Really can affect sleep. Have many dreams, usually bad, that sometimes can not determine from reality.

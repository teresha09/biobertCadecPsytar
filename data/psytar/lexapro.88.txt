Severe cotton mouth, mood was exceptionally elevated (too elevated) until it tapered off, Disturbing, lucid dream for about 6 weeks. Felt normal for about 8 months, and then I felt nothing. I wasn't depressed, or sad, or happy, or angry. I just was. After taking lexapro for a little over a year I decided to stop taking it as it was no longer working. I did this without doctor supervision . a horrible mistake as I had a feeling of euphoria for about 3 months. I did things I normally wouldn't do, bought expensive things I couldn't afford. Four years later and I'm still paying for it . in more ways than one! This was my first antidepressant and it worked great for a while. Changed my life. The withdrawal was awful. I couldn't sleep at night but all I wanted to do during the day was sleep, I had no appetite. After another year of no antidepressants I was prescribed Celexa, which works much better for me.

Initially, lose of appetite, sweating, dry mouth, constipation. Once body is adjusted, only side affect is rapid weight gain. When trying to decrease dose gradually, dizziness, migraines, head spinning, brain zaps, body weakness, nightmares. I will admit that this medicine helped me initially, but trying to go off of it is a horrible experience. I'm stepping down slowly and even doing that, I've experienced dizzyness, headaches. everything I mentioned to the point where I can't function. The symptoms are not slight. They are extreme and debilitating. Gained weight rapidly while on this drug. Now, despite following a healthy, moderate diet and regularly exercising, my body will not lose weight. I wish my doctor had found another drug for me initially. The risks/side effects are not worth the inital relief.

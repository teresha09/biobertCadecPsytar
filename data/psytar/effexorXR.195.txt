sexual dysfunction, sleeplessness, vivid dreams, yawning. It has improved my mood greatly, to the point of me being cheerful and having a positive outlook. I am far more talkative. The sexual dysfunction is not terrible and the sleeplessness is managable with sleeping tablets and hopefully it subsides soon.

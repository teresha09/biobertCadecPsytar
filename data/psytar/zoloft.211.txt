All side effects cleared after a few days usage. You should start with a smaller dose and work your way up to avoid more profound side effects. It causes heartburn if I take it and lay down, I find that I prefer to take it in the morning anyway for best results with me. Zoloft, whereas it's not a cure helps to relieve my anxiety/depression or in the worst case helps to make it manageable. It took away the running tingling sensations running down my arms and neck. Initially I felt a little worse (I already felt very wretched) but from past experience I knew that would clear if I could fight through it. I use this in combination with a small dose of Elavil and/or Trazedone to improve sleep (my sleep quality is poor with or without Zolot).
